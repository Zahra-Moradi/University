0,"Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?",movie
1,Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.,movie
2,"Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references.",movie
3,"Fun, brisk and imaginative",movie
4,"Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display.",movie
5,"This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic.",movie
6,"For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one.",movie
7,"Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.",movie
8,The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.,movie
9,This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.,movie
10,"Percy Jackson may not be ""Harry Potter good,"" but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly.",movie
11,"Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice.",movie
12,The main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained British actors.,movie
13,"Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology.",movie
14,"Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand.",movie
15,"A little bit worse than lifeless; it's clueless, like a Medusa running around with her head cut off.",movie
16,You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.,movie
17,"This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book.",movie
18,"Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations.",movie
19,An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.,movie
20,"With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure.",movie
21,"While this might not rival the later, better Harry Potter movies or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's more fun than you might expect.",movie
22,"Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise.",movie
23,"In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new.",movie
24,The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.,movie
25,"Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart.",movie
26,gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place,movie
27,"The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula.",movie
28,"Chris Columbus and his crew take a literal approach to spectacle that denies the magnificent use of weirdness and scale that famed stop-action animator Ray Harryhausen brought to such myth-inspired classics as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963)...",movie
29,"Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering.",movie
30,"The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series.",movie
31,Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.,movie
32,The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining.,movie
33,"Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work.",movie
34,The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.,movie
35,"The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical ""coming-of-age hero"" tropes. Still, while ""Percy Jackson"" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours.",movie
36,It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.,movie
37,Whew boy.,movie
38,My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids),movie
39,Sadly worthy of its dumping into the cinematic boneyard of wintry mid-February.,movie
40,"The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat.",movie
41,Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.,movie
42,"Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends.",movie
43,"Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic.",movie
44,Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount.,movie
45,"Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbit's wake.",movie
46,Too scary for younger fans of the popular book.,movie
47,The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor,movie
48,"...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better.",movie
49,"Sorry Mr. Jackson, but Harry Potter you ain't.",movie
50,"A clunky kid-sized epic, able to conjure colossal acts of Greek myth wonderment, but never brave enough to shut its pie hole and let the audience process the screen magic.",movie
51,Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans â€¦ The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories.,movie
52,"While winning the award for longest movie title, it is a film that only goes through the motions.",movie
53,Not without bright moments ... but the story is centered around a trio of young actors who simply aren't operating at the same skill level as their older costars.,movie
54,"Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs.",movie
55,"The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects.",movie
56,This is a kids' movie: Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.,movie
57,"While it certainly isn't terrible, it plays like a low-rent variation of the Harry Potter formula--innocuous but instantly forgettable.",movie
58,All you have at the end of it is an enervating feeling of deja vu.,movie
59,"Like its stars, the film is genial good company.",movie
60,It's apparent that Potter may at last have a worthy successor.,movie
61,"Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans.",movie
62,"There are lots of cool surprises along the way, and the special effects are fantastic, especially the ones that create Uma Thurman's Medusa snakedo.",movie
63,"Columbus and company have crafted an agreeable mythological jaunt the whole family will enjoy, and while I wouldn't pay more than matinee prices that still means making the quest to the multiplex is a journey worthy of the undertaking.",movie
64,Lerman has a presence even with a mouth full of bad dialogue.,movie
65,This film is replete with plot holes.,movie
66,Some moments of inspired silliness save this escapist adventure from complete dullness.,movie
67,"A dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both X-Men and Greek mythology but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever.",movie
68,...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied.,movie
69,"Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.",movie
70,"This is what a quality book adaptation should do, stand on it's own, while making you want to explore more. But JESUS! Can we stop the Apple Product Placements! I don't want to see a freaking iPhone in a Fantasy film!!!",movie
71,"Despite so much epic drama in Greek mythology from which to borrow, here we are given little sense of the magnitude of the clash between the quarrelsome gods...",movie
72,"""It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults.",movie
73,So trite and ludicrous it is no threat to the Harry Potter franchise,movie
74,...an attempt to replicate the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.,movie
75,"Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.",movie
76,"The technical wizardry is spectacular and the story is taut, pacy and consistently inventive.",movie
77,"The film is a rousing blend of special effects, but not so scary that children aged seven and above will spend the entire movie hiding behind their fingers.",movie
78,Percy Jackson & the Olympians is a dutifully made kids' fantasy film that Columbus handles with the basic approach that he wielded on his faithful but vanilla Harry Potter adaptations.,movie
79,"Chris Columbus was a safe choice behind the lens, and he doesn't throw up any surprises. Columbus brings a measured approach that works on the whole, delivering the expected mix of set-ups, set-pieces and edge of your seat showdowns.",movie
80,"An imaginative, if simplistic, visit to classical Greek mythology, an archetypal quest by a lad with paternal issues.",movie
81,"Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood.",movie
82,A slab of market research in search of an actual movie.,movie
83,Percy Jackson manages to make Greek mythology both fun and exciting and is sure to appeal to its key demographic.,movie
84,"Not bad, but JK Rowling can rest easy.",movie
85,There's plenty of larks to be had from a fast-moving fantasy that doesn't take its mythology too seriously and employs actors who don't look like teenage rabbits in headlights.,movie
86,"While you suspect it's really just a big Clash Of The Titans spoiler, there's enough action in Jackson to make it succeed on its own terms. Lerman's a likeable lead, though it's the game supporting cast that keeps you watching.",movie
87,"It's evidently Potter-ish, but unashamedly aimed at younger viewers - which makes the emphasis on the junior hero's fighting skills and a clearly misguided Las Vegas casino sequence all the more dismaying.",movie
88,"It is great to see Greek Mythology taking centre stage, even if people must say ""no way"", ""yes way"" when faced with a fire-breathing hydra.",movie
89,Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes.,movie
90,"If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul.",movie
91,"Very American, very crass and very underwhelming.",movie
92,"The story is told in bland, episodic fashion with no sense of drama or threat.",movie
93,This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordan's best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description.,movie
94,"It's fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and it's a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please.",movie
95,Remember the first time you saw Harry Potter on the big screen? This is more like the third time you saw him but with bigger effects and Greek mythology replacing the occult.,movie
96,The Greek gods had outsized powers and petty grievances. These Gen-Y demigods are no different - it's a whole generation of kids with daddy issues,movie
97,"A fun, effects-filled, escapist adventure, with several clever notions: Medusa sells garden statuary as a cover, and the Parthenon in Nashville is home to a hydra.",movie
98,"A safe, bland, test-marketed product made for tween mass consumption. Like most films arriving with ampersands and colons in the title, it's a bore.",movie
99,"It's all jolly good fun, rattling along at a perfect pace with enough action setpieces and spectacle to keep both youngsters and adults happy.",movie
100,What surprised me is that I had some affection for an action adventure film the way I would have in the days of the Ray Harryhausen's best films.,movie
101,"While this flick may not have Harry Potter's complex world and multiple layers, it also doesn't have the angst and darkness. It replaces them with one thing in bulk: Fun.",movie
102,... a sprightly Harry Potter clone and an eye-candy-coated intro to Greek mythology.,movie
103,click to read full review,movie
104,"Of all the would-be Potter projects that have hit the screen over the years, this is one of more polished and enjoyable ones.",movie
105,"A great family film, with just the right measures of action, mythological allusions, humor, and adventure.",movie
106,"Not a perfect film, but the movie does have a certain passion that a lot of other franchise attempts have lacked. If you like Greek mythology and are looking for an antidote to Clash of the Titans, this may be what you're looking for.",movie
107,Mildly diverting.,movie
108,"Just another mediocre fantasy flick, but if you enjoyed the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film.",movie
109,"An enjoyable PG-rated family adventure in its own right, but Columbus' film can't live up to the Potter gold standard, and it strays enough from Riordan's source material to make its tween readership blow a gasket every few minutes. [Blu-ray]",movie
110,Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief proves to be a satisfying beginning to what is sure to be a promising film franchise.,movie
111,Manages to pay its respects to the Greek myths and actually convey them as fun.,movie
112,It kind of just builds up to a lot of Not Much.,movie
113,"Percy Jackson is simply uninspired in every single meaning of the word. It's probably the crassest, most obviously derivative work of this sort since Eragon.",movie
114,The premise of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief holds great potential potential the film never realizes.,movie
115,It provides a great adventure movie for the family audience.,movie
116,The plot uses the presence of the Greek gods as an indistinct outline to influence teenagers who are more interested in the prestige and glamor of their connection than the responsibility that comes with it.,movie
117,"As a former middle school teacher of gifted literature, I value all fairly well-made films for children and parents and this one is in that league.",movie
118,"OK, but only just.",movie
119,There's nothing resembling a spark in this film anywhere.,movie
120,"Holofcener always gives us more to chew on than originally meets the eye in her films and she writes female characters with an intelligence, sensitivity and realism that blows the Sex and the City foursome away any day of the week.",movie
121,"The tone is low-key but very funny. Yet, at the same time, the film also manages to have a sardonic edge.",movie
122,"Of a piece with Nicole Holofcener's three other films -- talky, urbane ensemble flicks that elicit quiet but deeply sincere smiles and laughs, and just as often showcase hushed moments of pinprick vulnerability.",movie
123,Solid ensemble work with an especially good Catherine Keener.,movie
124,"It's a tricky kind of social satire, its possibly cloying self-absorption cut only by some winningly awkward characters.",movie
125,"The fourth teaming of gifted indie filmmaker Holofcener and talented actress Keener is a timely, sharply observed, femme-driven serio-comedy about postmodern capitalistic lifestyles with all their joys, guilts, complexities and contradictions.",movie
126,"Ah, the guilt of the privileged.",movie
127,One of the best movies ever about guilt as the guardian of our goodness and a sign of our yearning to belong to the larger world.,movie
128,"[Holofcener] has real sympathy -- characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here.",movie
129,"Such fine-tuned observation requires the ideal interpreter. Keener has always been Holofcener's muse, and once again offers the sort of fully crafted portrait that reminds us how shallow most movies really are.",movie
130,"With her new film, the poignant and funny Please Give, Holofcener is at the top of her game.",movie
131,"Listening to the banter in Please Give feels like eavesdropping on natural conversations, shaped and selected by a skilled storyteller.",movie
132,"With the romantic notion of the deceased 'haunting' their furniture..., the director at once adds some ethereal spirituality and an earthbound connection between people and their possessions.",movie
133,"Keener, Peet, and Hall are so strong, so empathetic even at their weakes",movie
134,Some people might find it distasteful to make a movie about guilty rich folks who give themselves permission to splurge. Others will rightly appreciate the honesty.,movie
135,"One of the best movies of the year so far. An insightful, darkly funny and multi-layered character study about class and family.",movie
136,"Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener.",movie
137,"Hardly a treasure, but it offers some modest rewards.",movie
138,Two possible ways of regarding Please Give: It's shallow. Or maybe it's deeply shallow.,movie
139,"Fleetingly amusing, charming and harmless with a terrific cast, but often meanders, lacks bite, and unevenly juggles comedy, drama and romance.",movie
140,Funny and heartbreaking.,movie
141,"Forget the dreaded ""Sex and the City 2."" Holofcener's wonderful new film about mammograms, marriage, infidelity, child-rearing and waiting for the old lady next door to die so you can buy her sprawling, pre-WWII apartment is the most sophisticated America",movie
142,"Please Give is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer's deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie - the fussiness.",movie
143,"In its casual, disarming way, it's as deep and as grand a film as you'll find",movie
144,Holofcener explores the contemporary female experience with a camera that is at once empathetic and merciless.,movie
145,"The movie is about imperfect characters in a difficult world, who mostly do the best they can under the circumstances, but not always. Do you realize what a revolutionary approach that is for a movie these days?",movie
146,"It's a wonderful movie full of people you wish you knew in real life, and like most of Holofcener's movies, it's a remarkable combination of comedy and tragedy.",movie
147,"Please Give is a series of such set-piece scenes, a breezy, though not negligible, exploration of the contest between avarice and empathy.",movie
148,Only Rebecca Hall comes through with a genuineness that rises above Holofcener's doodlings.,movie
149,"Please Give proves that a film can be a spectacularly rewarding experience by just providing time spent with well-written, believable adult characters.",movie
150,It recognizes that a film about unpleasant people need not be unpleasant itself as long as it remembers not to make them uninteresting as well.,movie
151,"As she has in four previous films, Holofcener smartly relies on Keener's talent to create a layered character who is neurotic and often inappropriate, but still good at her core.",movie
152,"Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it.",movie
153,"Yet another ramble through the tiny world of the affluent and the idle, a particular fascination of Holofcener's. The only difference this time is the increased emphasis on morbidity.",movie
154,The combination of good-nature and light snark [make] Please Give maybe the strongest film of Holofcener's career.,movie
155,Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.,movie
156,The film's premise yields a story that's insightful and engaging while touching on many other matters of love and money.,movie
157,There's no movie around right now with a subject more pertinent. It'll hit you hard.,movie
158,Please Give is one of those movies that can be enjoyed simply for its funny portraits of human foibles and fumbling grasps at intimacy -- but it's also deceivingly profound.,movie
159,"It's a movie about guilt and family and what we mean when we say something is valuable, all of which are great subjects.",movie
160,A funny and pointed take of class anxieties from the Woody Allen school,movie
161,"There are laughs and moments of pain and many instances of embarrassing (and deeply human) behavior throughout, but there's also delicacy and grace...",movie
162,"Nicole Holofcener is frequently lauded for writing vivid female characters, but such praise doesn't really do justice to her full game.",movie
163,"Touching, intelligent and full of charm and wit.",movie
164,"Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances.",movie
165,"While the characters contend with their precarious self-images, we can't help but reflect on ourselves as well. To borrow a cautionary phrase about that mirror: 'Objects may appear closer than they are.'",movie
166,A tremendous leap forward for filmmaker Nicole Holofcener...,movie
167,"[The script is] sharp and witty, but never forced, and features some of the best pure dialogue you'll hear this year.",movie
168,"In Please Give, Keener is at her best. Let's hope her creative partnership with Holofcener continues.",movie
169,"While Please Give is a film about conscience, it's also slyly funny, with piercing moments of insight and warmth.",movie
170,"In a Holofcener film, the usual rules of screenwriting do not apply, which lends her work a lifelike quality that's particularly refreshing in this era of formulaic remakes and sequels.",movie
171,"Give thrives because of these professional efforts, which help to mold something strangely poignant and thrillingly neurotic out of a plot that should rightfully be nothing more than a cinematic air horn.",movie
172,"Happily, the joy outweighs the guilt.",movie
173,"Exploring class, generations and misbehaving bodies, Holofcener's dramedy refines its character studies with warmth and wit as she creates warts-and-all individuals whose flawed humanity we warm to.",movie
174,"An indie with real pedigree and smarts, Holofcener's comedy of manners is well-observered and well worth watching.",movie
175,"Maybe things get worse, but movies like this at least make it easier to handle.",movie
176,"There's the rare occasion where the boldness of the dialogue is laid on a little thick and it drags you out of the moment, but it doesn't happen often, and the odd excess is more than forgiveable given just how well the rest of the film works.",movie
177,"Trifles, trivialities, frippery and froth. We've got plenty of words to describe things that don't matter. And now, we also have a film. Please Give.",movie
178,"Beautifully played and sharply-written, the pleasures on offer here are apparently throwaway but the authenticity of the characters freights the story with a light-hearted realism.",movie
179,"Holofcener's biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego.",movie
180,"Smart and touching, this is a must for lovers of human drama.",movie
181,"Enjoyable, emotionally engaging comedy-drama from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, featuring a sharply written script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a talented ensemble cast.",movie
182,"Funny yet emotional, tragic yet full of hope, this is the type of character-driven story theatergoers could use to see more of, and as like as Holofcener is around here's hope more is exactly what it is we are going to get.",movie
183,"Comes close to justifying the praise it has received -- close, but not entirely.",movie
184,"Nothing earth-shaking goes on here, and Holofcener has the good sense not to make her issues seem all that important. This is a lightweight comedy about mostly likable people who are a bit too wrapped up in self-analysis.",movie
185,Here's a sentence I've typed before: Rebecca Hall is the best thing about this movie. The British actress raises the level of every production she touches.,movie
186,Director/writer Nicole Holofcener goes back east for Please Give. It is an auspicious move.,movie
187,"Compare these wonderfully flawed, beautifully insecure and wholly believable characters with the preprogrammed mannequins seen in such chowderheaded efforts as, say, The Back-Up Plan or Killers, and the contrast is startling.",movie
188,Real joys and sorrows must be bigger and deeper than this.,movie
189,"It ends with this exchange: 'Thank You.' 'You're welcome.' How often do those simple words carry weight in a movie? At that moment, I loved those characters, and I loved this movie.",movie
190,an Upper East Side slice of navel gazing,movie
191,"Nicole Holofcener's lovely Please Give is a small, modest movie, full of the sort of characters we might know, or be.",movie
192,"If you're hoping for huge dramatic payoff or more than mild laughs from cynically satisfying script, then you're panhandling without a Styrofoam cup.",movie
193,This plot less movie lacks any momentum and you get no feeling of empathy or sympathy for any of the characters. The ensemble acting is sound with Guilbert standing out with a nostalgic trip down memory lane for viewers.,movie
194,Ms. Holofcener's observant talky comedy resonates with plenty of oomph as a believable modern-day fable about urban life.,movie
195,Nicole Holofcener creates open-ended characters whose ordinary lives are so fascinating that when the credits roll you're wondering why Transformers gets a sequel and not them.,movie
196,"In both Please Give and Friends with Money, she wrestles with our all-to-human desire for nice things but judiciously avoids ridiculing her characters for sharing a longing that is as universal as it is regrettable.",movie
197,"As Holofcener charts the telling little developments in these randomly connected lives the film offers wry smiles, smart repartee, mild whimsy and some plaintive, poignant moments.",movie
198,"A spiky, sophisticated, grown-up comedy...",movie
199,"Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.",movie
200,"This is a small film, which, if you're open to it, will draw you into the lives of people you quickly forget are fictional.",movie
201,"It sparks laughter by crossing the wires of human motivation, letting you see the hazards that exist in trying to be a good person.",movie
202,"Writer-director Holofcener cleverly keeps the emotions gurgling right under the surface of this engaging interpersonal comedy. It's more about smiles than laughing out loud, but the superior cast members get terrific characters to play with.",movie
203,"A well-written, well-acted dramatic comedy that is light on plot but generous in spirit.",movie
204,"It is well-observed but morally stunted, in that it suggests that charity is just another form of self-medication",movie
205,"Holofcener writes, and helps to shape on-screen, characters we often don't even like, and what do we do? We invite them home with us. Talk about a soft touch.",movie
206,A stroll with these characters is a refreshing break from from the usual film exercises.,movie
207,"Please Give is quintessential Holofcener -- a loopy, episodic ensemble story of women dealing with marriage, money and men, but it's also her smartest, most disciplined movie to date.",movie
208,"Keener, one of the most reliably entertaining actresses currently working, specializes in sardonic, flawed characters -- a perfect fit for Holofcener's image of the modern American woman.",movie
209,"Writer-director Nicole Holofcener seems to get better with every film, and now she's cruising along the well-trodden path of neurotic New Yorker comedy-drama with grace and comely confidence.",movie
210,"Keener has become Holofcener's artistic alter ego. In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy.",movie
211,"Nicole Holofcener, who writes the most interesting female characters in the movies, delivers another dazzling role to her muse, Catherine Keener, in Please Give, a delightfully dry dramedy about guilt.",movie
212,"The acting quality is strong, especially from the ever-reliable Catherine Keener as Kate, but it's almost impossible to care about her character's dilemmas.",movie
213,"The film lives at that uneasy intersection between affluence and compassion, where the well-meaning well-to-do try to figure out how much of their wealth they need to give away to make a difference.",movie
214,"The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.",movie
215,"Doesn't have much plot, just characters interacting and developing, and its lack of a need for drama is refreshing.",movie
216,"You have to be smart and funny and really aware of yourself to write and direct a film like this, which is exactly what director Nicole Holofcener is.",movie
217,"Funny at times, Please Give is a surprisingly heartwarming coming-of-age film for six adults all passing through different stages of heir life.",movie
218,"In writer/director Nicole Holofcener's crisp, poignant and funny new movie, Kipling's ""white man's burden"" has evolved into the liberal woman's guilt.",movie
219,"About the people who give, the people who don't give and how we finally manage to connect with one another.",movie
220,Obvious but entertaining portrayal of midlife crisis gone horribly awry.,movie
221,Highly over-rated Dudley Moore comedy.,movie
222,"And oh, the irony, that the film only deserves a '1.'",movie
223,It was a big hit. I have never understood why.,movie
224,"Sexist, juvenile, and pathetically structured, despite the gamest efforts of its actors and the blithe willingness of its famous non-actor.",movie
225,People tend to forget what a hilarious movie this really is,movie
226,"Blake Edwards's 10 is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts.",movie
227,"This passable but not great Blake Edwards picture became known for the huge impact that the beautiful Bo Derek had on hairstyle; Bo's stardom was shortlived, though.",movie
228,"Dudley Moore is periodically funny, Julie Andrews is mostly charming, and Bo Derek is always gorgeous.",movie
229,"10's tossed-off quality keeps it from greatness, but it also distinguishes it from the great mass of contemporary comedies smoothed to a shiny, edgeless formula. [Blu-ray]",movie
230,"A fascinating character study, bittersweet and insightful yet full of tremendous laughs.",movie
231,It has some gags - some are even quite funny - but not nearly enough.,movie
232,"In a time of bloated when special effects have become the real stars, going back to a classic like this can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting.",movie
233,Completely deserved its high status of undisputed classic.,movie
234,"While the composition of juries might change over time, the issues and attitudes that are explored here are timeless, as is this classic film.",movie
235,"12 Angry Men ranks as the tautest courtroom drama you'll ever see, surpassing Lumet's very good 1982 drama, The Verdict.",movie
236,Pure dynamite in movie form.,movie
237,"This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action.",movie
238,Sidney Lumet's debut feels a bit stagy but is never short on tension.,movie
239,"An intense concentration of power, and my all-time favourite film.",movie
240,"Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.",movie
241,One-room dramas don't get much better than this,movie
242,"Ainda que se passe em um nico ambiente, esta obra-prima possui um alcance emocional imensurvel - e  incrvel que tenha sido o primeiro longa-metragem de Lumet.",movie
243,This film is a great combination of an adult theme and the treatment suitable for younger audience.,movie
244,A masterful work of debate and dialogue; of shifting momentum and the ideal of sticking to your scruples in the face of antagonistic groupthink.,movie
245,"Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated feature directing debut is a brilliant courtroom drama, featuring a superlative cast that includes Henry Fonda (also producer), Martin Balsam, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, and E.G. Marshall.",movie

249,"taut, well-crafted sociological study",movie

254,an incisive and gripping film,movie
255,"This was Sidney Lumet's first movie and it's as riveting as it was back in the late 50s, when everything was changing.",movie
256,"The film takes a confined, almost completely banal real-world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme.",movie
257,"Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.",movie
258,"There is real value is how it allows each member of the cultural mosaic of a jury to develop into distinct, damaged, and interesting characters",movie
259,...the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.,movie
260,"In the 60 years since its release, Sidney Lumet's masterpiece has lost none of its impact. In this age of unreason, 12 Angry Men remains sorely and urgently contemporary.",movie
261,This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect.,movie
262,"""12 Angry Men"" puts the full range of human good and evil on display. It posits that, ultimately, the universe is benevolent, and our job, regarding each other, is to attempt with our best effort and greatest compassion to elucidate and clarify the truth.",movie
263,"Thought-provoking, continually riveting, and absolutely unforgettable - and surprisingly designed around a very simple, tightly budgeted, special-effects-free premise.",movie

273,"James Mason's portrayal of Captain Nemo is a hard-edged, dramatic performance, with no winking nods or cartoonish layers. You could transport Mason whole into a much darker movie with R-rated violence, and he would fit like a glove.",movie

277,A tedious bore in which grubby people stand around muttering in a variety of badly chosen accents.,movie
278,"Emmerich's epic is a formulaic mishmash of a movie, visually sweeping but silly blend of actioner, adventure, man vs. nature, man vs. animal -- above all, a reminder of how superior Mel Gibson's Apocalypto was.",movie
279,Roland Emmerich has a remarkable talent for draining all the life out of interesting stories.,movie
280,The kind of movie that people will discover new and hilarious ways to mock for years to come.,movie
281,I have to give Emmerich credit for creating a film that's been funnier than '27 Dresses' or 'Over Her Dead Body.',movie
282,"CGI effects are letter perfect believable. The opening mastodon hunt/stampede is as good as effects seen in the recent 'King Kong,' greatly enhancing the film.",movie
283,about as slow and lumbering as a wounded manuk.,movie
284,"Emmerich has never been one to rely on the wizardry of nuance, but I was stunned to feel numb to nearly everything B.C. offered, as if my mind immediately detected a filmmaker looking to brazenly cash in on his past successes.",movie
285,"In an age where ... audiences reward blood-and-thunder films ... at the box office, greenlighting 10,000 B.C. must have seemed logical. I can imagine someone pitching the film ...by saying ""It's like 300 .... + 9,700!""",movie
286,"Roland Emmerich is partial to cutting-edge special effects and stone-age storytelling, meaning that 10,000 B.C., a dim-witted CG extravaganza set in prehistoric times, is something like his ideal project.",movie
287,An atrocious waste of a perfectly good CGI budget ... at least the Geico commercials make an effort to get the historical accuracy right,movie
288,The little-prehistoric-epic-that-could actually delivers an entertaining couple of hours.,movie
289,"It's best not to think too hard about anything in 10,000 BC, a sublimely dunderheaded excursion into human prehistory.",movie
290,"While the movie is completely ridiculous, at least it's fun to think of all the high school students who are going to mistake this movie for an accurate historical record and get F's on their next pop quiz.",movie
291,"Emmerich knows how to fill the screen with spectacle, but not how to field-marshal it.",movie
292,"An epic adventure of such towering testosterone counts and ceaseless tedium, you can almost feel the hair growing on your chest as the bags collect beneath your eyes.",movie
293,"Almost worth sitting through the first half for the revelatory moment when you're forced to ask yourself: Is nearly the entire cast suddenly being attacked by what look like cracked-out ostriches? Why, yes, yes they are.",movie
294,"Worst of all, no one even gets eaten by the disappointingly tame saber-toothed tiger.",movie
295,"Sometimes you have a hankering for a slab of 10,000-year-old cheese. Here it is, on a cracker.",movie
296,"May indeed last until the end of time, kept alive in drinking games and in history and geography classrooms on April Fool's Day.",movie
297,This crackpot combination of Pathfinder and Apocalypto [is] a brainless exercise in prehistoric goofiness that actually affords more laughs than Ice Age.,movie
298,"I can't figure out exactly when the film 10,000 B.C. is set, but it's definitely ancient times. Like before they had cars, guns or tabloid blogs. And definitely before they had cohesive plots or dialogue that made sense.",movie
299,"While there's an attempt to make this a personal story, it's really about what we thought it would be: Incredible vistas populated with a combination of ancient temples, pyramids, woolly mammoths and a cast of (CGI) thousands.",movie
300,"Too dumb to take seriously, but just silly enough to be sort of fun.",movie
301,"This much-delayed film cries out for consideration for Worst CGI, Most Annoying Narrator, Lamest Dialogue and Dumbest Action Hero.",movie
302,Even a cameo by Pauly Shore in Encino Man would liven up this bombastic bore.,movie
303,"10,000 B.C. is a movie of woolly mammoths and fuzzy thinking.",movie
304,"The best acting comes from woolly mammoths, man-eating ostriches and a saber-toothed tiger -- and those babies are digital. It's the human actors who look fake.",movie
305,"10,000 B.C. isn't only brain-dead, it's completely dead. It's inert and without a heartbeat.",movie
306,Where's Raquel Welch in that fur bikini?,movie
307,Yabba-dabba-don't.,movie
308,"While the special effects are top notch... the humans are dull, the dialogue is ridiculous, and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in 300 is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure.",movie
309,"The less said about historical accuracy, the better.",movie
310,"The characters may speak English, but the narrative is gibberish.",movie
311,"Outrageous and outlandish, Emmerich's 10,000 BC is easy to mock, but it is so cheerfully shameless and terminally silly that you have to admire its effrontery and accept its creator... as a certified crackpot visionary.",movie
312,"Hey, CG mammoths! And lots of 'em! And some raptor/dodo thingies that move exactly like Spielberg's dinosaurs. Still, looks cool enough. Could've used some more of the saber-toothed tiger, though.",movie
313,A strong camp sensibility is just about the only thing that might have saved this lumbering beast.,movie
314,"10,000 B.C. is a true disaster on every level, a derivative and sometimes incomprehensible mess.",movie
315,"The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by ancient phorusrhacid fossils, are idiotic but... okay, they're idiotic.",movie
316,"If you thought 300 was silly, think of 10,000 BC as 33.333 times sillier.",movie
317,Barney Rubble had a lot more charisma than anyone involved in this movie.,movie
318,"You may be expecting a showcase of cutting-edge visuals -- isn't the appeal of the title the implicit promise of seeing a lost world re-created to presumably dazzling effect? But for the most part, it's just barren landscapes and people in animal skins.",movie
319,It made me yearn to see Caveman again. At least that was intentionally funny.,movie
320,"[I] saith to you that I had a strangely good time, and whether that is from laughing at 10,000 B.C. or laughing with it I knoweth not, although I strongly suspect the former.",movie
321,"There have been funny movies about prehistoric times ... but for real gut-busting laughs, it's hard to top the ridiculousness of 10,000 B.C.",movie
322,"Even as a fantasy spectacle, 10,000 B.C. is sorely in need of intelligent design.",movie
323,"Too much of 10,000 BC seems to be sampled from other movies that preceded it",movie
324,"It promises spectacle and action but fails to deliver all that much of either, and ends up being so dull it can't even be enjoyed for its camp value.",movie
325,"Our favorite Teutonic huckster presumes that prehistory means that anything narrative goes: hey, who can prove him wrong?",movie
326,"10,000 B.C. takes a prehistoric approach to storytelling.",movie
327,"This may well be the first prehistoric epic in which the liberal deployment of such words as ""oog,"" ""agh"" and ""uck"" would have actually improved the screenplay considerably.",movie
328,"As a series of set pieces looking for any available fable to keep it afloat, 10,000 BC is really nothing more than computing power and implausibility.",movie
329,Director Roland Emmerich is the ultimate spectacle over substance filmmaker. He actually makes Michael Bay look like Stanley Kubrick by comparison.,movie
330,"If you are ten years old fan of video games with a short attention span and no knowledge of history, you will love this movie. The further you stray from these core qualifications, the less you will love it.",movie
331,"...it's laughably bad, which means that if you can approach it as a really stupid film you just might find yourself enjoying it.",movie
332,The film proves to be uncharacteristically restrained.,movie
333,Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals.,movie
334,"This is just stupidly lazy storytelling, nothing more (and certainly nothing less), and I'd tell the director to be ashamed of himself but I'm pretty darn positive he didn't even notice he did anything wrong.",movie
335,"While admittedly formulaic and banal, it's also a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy watching stampeding herds of woolly mammoths.",movie
336,"10,000 B.C. is a load of crap dressed up with pretty background vistas. The film is terminally lifeless, something that a so-called 'event' picture should never be.",movie
337,"On a Neanderthal level, ""10,000 B.C."" works.",movie
338,One of the stupidest and most boring films of the year.,movie
339,"Visually, historically and creatively, this film dishonors the year 10,000 B.C.",movie
340,This is actually a movie you forget while watching it.,movie
341,"'A sweeping odyssey into a mythical age of prophesies and gods,' according to the press notes; it's also a sweeping odyssey into a mythical age in which snow is referred to even by Ice Age veterans as 'the great white rain'...",movie
342,"Making prehistoric people talk and behave just like modern people in a 10,000 B.C. setting makes actors look silly. Their costumes are silly, the settings are silly, and the whole movie is unintentionally funny.",movie
343,"My poor brain hung in there for as long as it could, but it lost its grip during the giant chicken attack and I haven't seen it since.",movie
344,"If Mel Gibson remade Apocalypto and cast it with the Geico cavemen, he might end up with something akin to 10,000 B.C..",movie
345,Just barely good enough to fulfill the needs of an audience starved for any sort of effects-driven film that hardly sticks in the brain for more than a few minutes after it's over.,movie
346,"Good special effects are expensive, so the filmmakers are forced to use unimpressive actors to fill in the spaces between the CGI creations.",movie
347,"Neither grand enough to be impressive nor antic enough to be charming, the movie settles for bland and frantic, climaxing in a showdown among decadent pyramid builders.",movie
348,Sets new standards for stupidity. This is like Uwe Boll with a budget. This is the village idiot of movies.,movie
349,This year's first Event Movie is almost guaranteed to wind up as its dumbest.,movie
350,"Strait has to be one of the most unsympathetic cardboard heroes of the genre, while Bell leaves little reason to care for her beyond her bitching dreadlocks...",movie
351,"Even though there's never a hint of either research or gritty realism, it's still good fun.",movie
352,Roland Emmerich's great big CGI blockbuster lumbers along like one of the woolly mammoths that roam across the screen.,movie
353,"Don't expect Roland Emmerich's 10,000BC to make much sense, historically, geographically or logically.",movie
354,Should have been a lot more fun.,movie
355,"Roland Emmerich loves to make big, dumb movies, and though this may not be his biggest, it's certainly his dumbest.",movie
356,Take the kids along; unless you want them to grow up to be palaeontologists.,movie
357,"Like the lumbering mammoths, it is plodding and dull.",movie
358,"With too much talk, not enough adventure and a laughable disregard for geography and anthropology, 10,000 BC is less Jurassic Park than Pleistocene parp.",movie
359,"One can only infer that, in order for it to be taken seriously, the makers expected audiences to forget pretty much every movie they'd ever seen before in their entire life.",movie
360,"strictly a popcorn flick version of Joseph Campell's hero's journey that looks great even as it plays fast and very loose with geography, biology, and anything else that gets in its way",movie
361,"A blind man is brought up on a slab from beneath the earth, where he has spent years cooped up in cramped quarters with nothing to keep him entertained. After spending two hours in a darkened theater watching 10,000 B.C., I could relate.",movie
362,"With a dreadfully dull story and performances as petrified as 12,000-year-old wooden artifacts, 10,000 BC shambles along as if on a march to its own extinction.",movie
363,"I don't know about you, but if I want to get excited about an ancient mammal I'll tune in Janice Dickinson.",movie
364,"You actually have to feel sorry for the actors, one of which is New Zealander Cliff Curtis, the only person I recognised.",movie
365,"It's just a wrong movie altogether, an elaborately nonsensical stew of crazy costumes, bizarre accessories, and funny voices.",movie
366,"it is hard to be enthralled with the dusty, warmed-over romantic fixations of what is essentially a very handsome cave-couple",movie
367,"I enjoyed the movie, so it qualifies as a mammoth guilty pleasure",movie
368,It's a film that countryman Uwe Boll would have made had he the budget and the cinematographer,movie
369,The actors speak in fluent anachronistic English. The dialogue is prehistoric but not in the way Emmerich intended.,movie
370,"crap, and more crap in a crap bucket",movie
371,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,movie
372,"ena matso kakomoirides sernontai stin ammo kai ton ilio, s' ena ftino, proheiro, afeles kai kakogoysto deigma karampinatis gerontikis anoias toy Emmerich",movie
373,The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing this movie to enter a movie theatre. It was like a bad made for TV special that you would see on ABC or NBC.,movie
374,"In fact, while sitting through this banal attempt at a big-scale epic, I could not help but go through a checklist in my mind of all the movies ""10,000 B.C."" borrows from.",movie
375,It was a pleasant surprise.,movie
376,"But the folks who made 10,000 B.C. have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst.",movie
377,...most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end.,movie
378,A disaster that can't even get the computer generated images right.,movie
379,"Would make a good drinking game; silly fun but not ""good."" A critic sitting near me snorted in derision at my ""the costumes kicked ass,"" but I won't back down. They were really cool.",movie
380,"People expecting a fun action movie will be severely disappointed. If you get drunk with some buddies and go to make fun of it, you might like it more. But that doesn't make it a good movie",movie
381,Brace yourself for a mammoth disappointment.,movie
382,"10,000 BC takes film making back to the stone age...",movie
383,"Violent, poorly conceived prehistoric action.",movie
384,"Some backgrounds look as though Roland Emmerich and crew broke into a museum after hours and filmed in dioramas. Rather than a disaster film, this was just plain disaster - a departure from Emmerich's usually effective milieu and his most moronic movie.",movie
385,One of the biggest problems with the film is the casting.,movie
386,"All [Emmerich] cares about is not being boring. On that level, he succeeds.",movie
387,"A lousier adventure movie you won't find this year: 10,000 B.C. belongs, if not back in the stone age, then at least back in the mid '90s, where this sort of mindless, effects-driven drivel is best left.",movie
388,A prehistoric train wreck.,movie
389,"Nothing more than a standard boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy becomes a man to save the girl, with the Geico cavemen thrown in.",movie
390,A remarkably beautiful yet soulless film.,movie
391,"If you haven't seen it, do.",movie
392,"The 39 Steps (1935) is one of the earlier Alfred Hitchcock British spy-chase suspense-thrillers from a vintage period, his 18th film. Considered his first real masterpiece, it is both a crowd-pleasing box-office success and an extremely influential film",movie
393,It's almost cleansing to see a film like this which doesn't insult your intelligence.,movie
394,"The ""innocent man"" notion has been copied and recopied for decades, but few have the minerals to stand with this one.",movie
395,A brilliant piece of pure -- and purely enjoyable -- filmmaking.,movie
396,"As dull as anything Hitchcock has done, save the exhilerating final 10 minutes.",movie
397,"Wonderful early sound, quite British Hitchcock thriller",movie
398,"O excesso de coincidncias leva o roteiro a soar maniquesta (bem como a ""tenso sexual"" entre Donat e Carroll), mas a direo de Hitchcock, como sempre, salva o filme.",movie
399,Brilliant early Hitch,movie
400,"This film couldn't be more entertaining, even if it had 40 steps.",movie
401,Hitchcock at his very best.,movie
402,Far more substance than other thrillers.,movie
403,"Holding up extremely well, 39 Steps, Hitchcock's most commercial UK film, mixes successfuly suspense, comedy, and romance, serving as format for many later pictures (especially North by Northwest).",movie
404,"an indelibly fun movie, one of Hitchcock's early triumphs of sheer enjoyment",movie
405,"The 39 Steps is sexy, exciting, unexpectedly moving (thanks to Peggy Ashcroft's portrayal of a lonely woman married to a brutish farmer), and wholly unpredictable, with an ending that nicely loops back to the start.",movie
406,"Classic Hitchcock suspense, some drinking and smoking.",movie
407,At its most breathtaking when both Hitchcock and his characters fully embrace the surreality of the story,movie
408,"Surprisingly fast-paced for a 1935 film, full of twists and turns, and when the unlikely couple becomes handcuffed together and are forced to pretend they are married, it really kicks into high gear. Donat and Carroll have chemistry to burn.",movie
409,Alfred Hitchcock brings John Buchan's novel to the screen with characteristic wit and verve.,movie
410,"The scene in which Mr Memory is asked at the London Palladium ""What are the 39 Steps?"" remains one of 20th-century cinema's most gripping moments.",movie
411,The lack of chemistry between Donat and Carroll's respective characters only compounds the hands-off feel...,movie
412,"The 39 Steps is light, urbane, sexy as hell, and as so much of Hitchcock was so often, right about everything.",movie
413,"Made in England 1935, 'The 39 Steps' isn't the first Hitchcock film constructed around ""the wrong man"" conceit, but it's one where he found his touch.",movie
414,"A noteworthy example of Hitchcock's early thrillers, riddled with plotting, backstabbing, clever twists, and the big reveal of the meaning behind the title.",movie
415,"Fine Daves, Ford collaborative western",movie
416,It's rather talky but always remains lively and tense.,movie
417,A taut Western (obviously inspired by High Noon) about a lone man bravely standing on principle when all others have abandoned him. Marred only by a phony ending.,movie
418,This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.,movie
419,"Made in the vein of The Gunfighter and High Noon, this mature psychological Western is arguably Delmer Daves best film, featuring Van Heflin (in the Gary Cooper role) and Glenn Ford as the bad-good guy at their most appealing and accomplished.",movie
420,"During the 1950s, the Western grew a conscience.",movie
421,An enjoyable western that's an excellent reminder of how - in the world of movies - sometimes less is best.,movie
422,"Though masterful in stretches, it ultimately mistakes feel-good qualities for truly satisfying ones.",movie
423,The new 3:10 to Yuma will have to be quite a film to stand up to the original.,movie
424,A sturdy genre piece.,movie
425,"The minutes tick toward 3:10, and all we can do is watch and hope that it all turns out ok. That's the best kind of Western, one that allows feelings like that to emerge while watching.",movie
426,No amount of climactic train smoke can mask the fact that the finale is fancifully optimistic gibberish.,movie
427,"Although not as nerve-wracking as High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma is even more claustrophobicâ€¦ and the two-character drama is more intriguing than High Noon's protagonist standing alone.",movie
428,"A portrait of storytelling made for and by the Silent Generation, an audience all too familiar with the world's spooky, white-knuckled moral twilight.",movie
429,"Daves isn't interested in cynicism. Redemption is probably too big a stretch as well, but there's plenty of room in-between.",movie
430,"Distinguished by its thoughtfulness regarding the nature of Western heroism, as defined not only by dead-eye gunplay, but by family, community, and moral rectitude. [Criterion Blu-ray]",movie
431,"Like The Gunfighter and Winchester '73, 3:10 to Yuma is one of those defining '50s Westerns that is well-known by film buffs but has never reached the familiarity level of a High Noon or Shane.",movie
432,It is hard to imagine a better Ben Wade than Glenn Ford.,movie
433,"Mind games replace gunplay to the point that, while the film's running time doesn't outstay its welcome, those expecting a nonstop shootout extravaganza may leave unsatisfied.",movie
434,The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.,movie
435,Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions.,movie
436,"Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.",movie

439,"Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.",movie
440,"The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.",movie
441,"If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.",movie
442,A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.,movie
443,An archaic biopic.,movie
444,Recommended solely for Walter Huston's performance.,movie
445,It is quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President.,movie
446,"Feels like a relic, a sad, weak swan song from one of cinema's most legendary filmmakers.",movie
447,"...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.",movie
448,The picture is melancholy remembrance and its sources of fear are intimate and brilliant.,movie
449,"A horror movie that sits there and drags and seems very full of itself, and is based on the premise that puddles are scary. They're not.",movie
450,"just beneath its surface horror this film conceals a deep reservoir of tragedy, addressing themes like family breakdown, isolation, abandonment, and - something of a taboo in Japan - the terrible legacy of mental illness.",movie
451,"With extremely heavy echoes of his own 1998 film Ringu, Nakata is on subtle creep-out form here rather than big horror movie mode.",movie
452,"To date, the scariest movie I've ever seen.",movie
453,"Um terror bem construdo que no quer apenas provocar sustos passageiros, mas sim estabelecer um clima de tenso constante e personagens com os quais realmente nos importemos.",movie
454,So much of Dark Water is contrived that it defies the mind to try to make sense of it.,movie
455,"He [Nakata] wants us to absorb, to feel a location, and to understand the plight of the characters before he goes any further.",movie

465,"In her first Oscar role, Jodie Foster's gang-raped waitress transforms from a good-time hard-drinking girl to a woman fighting for the self-esteem she never had.",movie
466,"Possibly the best performance Foster has even given, and the best of its type",movie
467,"Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for.",movie
468,Garcia's overindulgence is punishing but I didn't come to the theatre to be soaked in soap opera sentiment.,movie
469,"Garcia offers the film to the Cuban community as something we should all be happy to see, but his esteem does not excuse the film's aesthetic mediocrity, cultural ignorance, and colossal self-absorption.",movie
470,Andy Garcia takes his time showing putting a plague on both the houses of Batista and Castro.,movie
471,"A lot goes wrong in this overlong movie, but it has a human touch.",movie
472,"Garcia's aching nostalgia for the glittering Havana of his dreams is palpable, but he winds up painting by the same 'doomed romance against a backdrop of revolution' numbers as piffle like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.",movie
473,... a lost movie that seems like it takes 16 years to end.,movie
474,"How the movie's politics will sit with the audience aside, one of the problems in this overlong melodrama is the distracting casting of Bill Murray as a wisecracking sidekick and Dustin Hoffman as mobster Meyer Lansky.",movie
475,"The sprawling -- two hours, 23 minutes -- epic meanders in places and its mix of tones and templates do not always serve its narrative. But the movie comes from the heart, filled with a passion that carries it through its rougher patches.",movie
476,"Havana may remain, in many ways, a lost city, but it'll take more than this movie to find it.",movie
477,... the film seems like a mini-series edited to feature length without time for character development.,movie
478,"The Lost City manages to make Havana, Sydney Pollack's disastrous 1990 attempt at a Casablanca homage set against the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford, look good by comparison.",movie
479,... a haphazard jumble.,movie
480,"Noteworthy and well-intended, The Lost City isn't exactly a lost opportunity, just a sincerely limited one.",movie
481,... a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly two and a half hours without saying much ...,movie
482,"As a director, Garcia is such a sucker for gratuitous crosscutting and glossily elliptical filmmaking that viewers can be forgiven for mistaking Lost City for a 143-minute montage sequence.",movie
483,This is a very sad and winsome film.,movie
484,Handsomely executed but hopelessly flawed.,movie
485,"Throbbing with music, seething with anger and romance, The Lost City is a film that breaks your heart, bewilders, alienates and ravishes you by turns.",movie
486,"The Lost City has a subject, a setting and a historical backdrop, but in the foreground it has a relatively passive protagonist, Fico, whose passions are understated and whose fortunes inspire only minor concern.",movie
487,"Overdirected, yes, but it's an epic, passionate portrayal.",movie
488,"Feels like the distillation of countless conversations and family legends, rehearsed from time immemorial by Cubans who fled their homeland and sought to re-create it in their memories.",movie
489,It's the sort of epic that aspires to tell Cuba's modern political history and celebrate its people without introducing us to a single believable character.,movie
490,"Musical...handsome...poignantly nostalgic...The Lost City is a lot of things, but what it's not is incisive.",movie
491,"... full of characters with import more symbolic than dramatic (Bill Murray plays a veritable court jester), ideas that wander and contradictions that dissipate.",movie
492,"You can see why Garcia was drawn to this material, but he hasn't had much luck shaping it into a film.",movie
493,"As a musical fever dream of paradise lost, The Lost City is a flawed success, boasting just enough truth and admirable purpose to justify the hazards of Garcia's passion.",movie
494,"Though the filmmaker's feel for his Cuban heritage is bone-deep, it's a glazed and dolorous movie -- a depressed epic.",movie
495,"Lovely to look at, and its mixture of Cuban standards and Garcia originals is delightful to listen to.",movie
496,"The coming CD, not the DVD, should be the keeper.",movie
497,"Somewhere amid the bric-a-brac -- hot rhythms, ocean breezes and political upheaval and melodrama -- a movie languishes. Garcia never really finds it.",movie
498,"A pretty bauble, a trinket offered when the stakes of barter were life and death.",movie
499,"What makes this movie interesting is the family (and not just because it's made up of 3 beautiful brothers). It's a love story, between a man and a woman and between a people and their country.",movie
500,"While earnest in intent and visually elegant, simply too narratively amorphous and emotionally desiccated.",movie
501,"If you want to see a good, entertaining movie about Havana, circa 1958, better to rent Havana, than waste your money on this turkey.",movie
502,Garcia's fans and viewers who love Cuban music will probably enjoy The Lost City if they don't mind the long run time.,movie
503,"Our cue that Garcia is acting is when he furiously bats his eyes in his smoldering emotional scenes. Either that, or he's allergic to the smoke from all those Cuban cigars.",movie
504,"It's barely coherent as it is, but at 2 hours and 23 minutes, The Lost City is simply infuriating.",movie
505,"Too scattered, too confused, too patched-together to work dramatically.",movie
506,The movie has too many stories to tell and tells none of them very well.,movie
507,"Turgid, lumpy and almost unwatchably dull.",movie
508,"It's a potent work, enlivened by fabulous Cuban music and Garcia's obvious love for his land and his culture.",movie
509,"Unfortunately, Garcia is inept as a director. His scenes are shapeless and bloated with self-important speeches.",movie
510,Unsteady but often entrancing.,movie
511,"Somehow simultaneously too much and not enough. At 143 minutes, it well overstays its welcome as a movie, but with a little more fleshing out it might have worked as a miniseries.",movie
512,"It's handsome and heartfelt but mired in murky politics, plot inertia, musical montages and painfully pointed symbolism.",movie
513,Garcia needed better guiding hands and eyes in the editing room to jettison the many parts that bog down the story.,movie
514,"... when it finds its footing, it becomes the movie it longs to be. And that happens often enough to make it worth finding, even when it seems as lost as the city it loves.",movie
515,"Even though the movie is made with an abundance of heart, it's sad to report that the final result has only a weak pulse.",movie
516,"Book-ended by fine songs; in between, Garcia offers more than two hours of clumsy Coppola/Scorsese karaoke...",movie
517,"For a tribute to a lost city, Garcia has made a lost film.",movie
518,"The result has a potluck rather than persuasive, integrated quality.",movie
519,Garcia's storytelling lacks highs and lows and has far too much going on. And on.,movie
520,"While the soundtrack of Cuban dance music is superb, this historical drama is leaden and simply too long-winded for its own good.",movie
521,"...plays like a confusing and inferior Caribbean analog to The Godfather, without anything like the narrative drive of Coppola's film.",movie
522,"It's by no means a flawless film, but it's a meaty one, and if you're a big fan of Andy Garcia, I'd definitely recommend it. (Plus, Bill Murray's in there.)",movie
523,Garcia obviously has more ambition than skill.,movie
524,"Andy Garcia's directorial debut is a flawed and overlong but nonetheless watchable drama with strong performances, a superb soundtrack and bizarre appearances from Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray.",movie
525,"'The Lost City' is intriguing as a historical document and adequate as cinema, but it has a blandness at its core that no amount of spicy mambo and booty-quaking dance routines can disguise.",movie
526,"There may be a good film here, but it struggles to break free of the cumbersome framework.",movie
527,"Andy Garcia's preposterous vanity project The Lost City is an all-singing, all-dancing version of the Cuban Revolution.",movie
528,"The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl.",movie
529,"Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.",movie
530,"Not an embarrassment, but definitely a missed opportunity.",movie
531,By the half way point I was beginning to take back everything I said re Steven Soderbergh's dull-as-ditchwater Che: Part II - even he manages to drum up more tension than this.,movie
532,Clearly the best movie adaptation of a Hemingway novel.,movie
533,"The Breaking Point adapts Hemingway's book and wrings out some genuine notes of solid tragedy, as well as a more nuanced performance from its lead actor.",movie
534,The insistence and courage of the film's final shot elevates it from a very good film to a nearly great one.,movie
535,"Harry may be tough, but in Curtiz' hands he's basically a nice guy in noirland.",movie
536,"Phyllis Thaxter steals the show. Her scenes are the best in the movie, and some of the best domestic scenes in cinema history. You don't often see a husband and wife on equal footing like this, nor do you see it this sexually charged.",movie
537,"Arguably the superior mounting of the Ernest Hemingway story, The Breaking Point proves moral gloom exists as equally and virulently sunny-side up.",movie
538,"Adam's Rib gives us writers, performers and a director all operating at peak levels of performance; it's a classic comedy.",movie

540,"Enjoyable Tracy-Hepburn comedy. Maybe not great, but very good",movie
541,Of Adam's Rib we might say...that it isn't solid food but it certainly is meaty and juicy and comically nourishing.,movie
542,Really funny movie. I enjoyed this one!,movie
543,Classic stuff.,movie
544,"Sex Wars mid-century style. Adam's Rib can't help but look a bit dated, but it sure is a perfect encapsulation of a certain type of couple at a certain time.",movie
545,"A well-written and acted comedy that was ahead of its time in counterpointing some basic assumptions, that there are certain ""male"" and ""female"" qualities and that each gender can and must exchange these qualities as trading cards.",movie
546,"It lost some of its luster with time, but it's still amusing.",movie
547,Irresistable comedy from one of Hollywood's greatest pairings.,movie
548,"Thanks to an at times sharp script, solid lead performances, and a scene stealing supporting turn by Judy Holliday, Adam's Rib is an entertaining enough film to warrant a solid review. But one of the great comedies of all time? Not even close.",movie
549,"Despite many improbabilities, this is a barbed and entertaining comedy thanks to some great casting and a very clever Kanin/Gordon script",movie
550,It feels as if it's more about how a couple can playfully fight while facing off in a courtroom rather than whether or not women should be treated impartially.,movie
551,Pedestrian...a high-minded snoozer studded with stars who all seem almost perversely miscast and directed in a grimly deliberate style designed to italicize every point.,movie
552,None of the performances work.,movie
553,"Unlike the bridge, the movie unravels at a very slow pace.",movie
554,"Though handsomely mounted, this parable of intersecting destinies and implacable tragedy is as lifeless as a wax tableau.",movie
555,The Bridge of San Luis Rey raises an important philosophical question: Is it better to fall to one's death from a rickety rope bridge overlooking a deep gorge or watch this miserable movie about several people sharing that awful fate?,movie
556,An endless powdered-wigs-and-feathered-pen slog.,movie
557,So dully written and executed that you'll be wishing the production had collapsed instead of the swaying bridge of San Luis Rey.,movie
558,The Viceroy states that they are 'surrounded by an ocean of boredom' - then you realize you're swimming in it.,movie
559,"How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates, Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham and Geraldine Chaplin? That bad, alas.",movie
560,"Audiences may wonder why a picture with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates and Harvey Keitel would be so bereft of hype. After you've endured the film, all 120 airless minutes, you'll understand the rationale behind the quiet release.",movie
561,"As a director, McGuckian is overwhelmed by the immensity of her cast, and her misguided attempt to make a Hollywood epic on a European production budget.",movie
562,"It is an intense philosophical undertaking that examines questions of faith, fate and chance.",movie
563,Best characterized as an honourable folly.,movie

566,"How to turn an embarrassment of riches into an embarrassment, period.",movie
567,The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful movie. The film's shooting locations are exquisite. The sets are stunning. The costumes are gorgeous. The actors are superlative. Too bad the movie sucks.,movie
568,A neat noir thriller.,movie

571,Director Losey and screenwriter Trumbo aren't providing the usual mystery tale here.,movie
572,The rectangle-within-a-rectangle symmetry of the window within the frame of the movie screen in the opening scene reinforces the notion that the filmgoer is essentially a licensed Peeping Tom...,movie
573,"The Prowler becomes a twisted vision of American entrepreneurship, with the two leads forming a grotesque nuclear family.",movie

575,We got two and a half more months of crap to go before we get to the holiday/awards season.,movie
576,"Produced by Soderbergh, Criminal bears an uncanny resemblance to the master's films.",movie
577,"The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs.",movie
578,Criminal's biggest offense may be that Jacobs and his actors make absolutely no attempt to rewrite Nine Queens.,movie
579,[Full of] fine acting and sharp dialog.,movie
580,"By the end, those who haven't seen Nine Queens may applaud the entertaining sleight-of-hand...those who have may lament that Criminal is the proverbial old dog.",movie
581,"The result isn't as compelling as Nine Queens, but it's a respectable caper movie in the tradition of The Sting and David Mamet's Heist.",movie
582,A classic crime caper that twists and turns with an easy subtly.,movie
583,an easy mark to make and a hard movie to sell to paying customers.,movie
584,A retread and it feels like it.,movie
585,The returns will be diminished for those too familiar with the story.,movie

588,"We know someone is pulling something, and someone is going to get away with something, and someone is going to be left holding the bag of cheese, but Jacobs keeps us on our toes.",movie
589,Manages to satisfy despite being inferior to the original on nearly every level.,movie
590,John C. Reilly stars as a gimlet-eyed con man in this clever and diverting adaptation of the Argentine thriller Nine Queens.,movie
591,"Inherently calculated and cold, so smugly satisfied with itself and its surprise final trick that it seems to be running its own con to convince us the script's house of cards is actually substantial, original and slick.",movie
592,A reminder of the genre's irresistible lure and what pleasures can be derived when it cares enough to do things right.,movie
593,"A light, speedy movie, as agreeably modest as a pop hit or a BLT.",movie
594,"Habitual duplicity and backstabbing create a stimulating, deceptively intricate plot maze in this sharp, shrewd, but not showy remake.",movie
595,"It's all done with sufficient style that, when we get there, the end no longer feels like the point.",movie
596,"The finest tribute I can lavish on this stateside remake of 2002's Argentinean export Nine Queens is that it took me a full hour to remember I had seen the original -- and reviewed it, no less.",movie
597,Criminal does what every good con-game movie should: It keeps you guessing.,movie
598,Criminal is the sort of movie David Mamet would love -- or make.,movie
599,"This remake of the Argentine hit is effective at times, and Gyllenhaal shows a new side of her talent, but the main impression is of first-rate performers doing second-rate work.",movie
600,"It's hip, witty and fun, and will remind you why movies are made in the first place.",movie
601,It's an auspicious debut for first-timer Gregory Jacobs.,movie
602,Fans of con-man capers will have no regrets after watching Criminal.,movie
603,"Jacobs doesn't add anything new to the genre, but his version of taking the concepts out for a walk is entertaining enough to mark time until Ocean's Twelve.",movie
604,"A strong cast and some nice surprises, but misses the sparkle of the original.",movie
605,"The performances are winning -- Gyllenhaal is particularly sharp as an aggrieved sibling, and there's mutual zing in her scenes with Reilly.",movie
606,An exercise where viewers are likely to ponder not 'How did the characters do it?' but 'Who cares?',movie
607,"May not be any great shakes as a cinematic puzzle, but it gives Reilly and Luna an opportunity to perform a thespian song-and-dance routine.",movie
608,"...newbies looking for an easy-breezy Ocean's Eleven-and-a-Half should get a kick out of this frugally low-key, innocuous cover song of a caper.",movie
609,"It is near impossible to make a great movie about con artists, because of the very nature of the genre itself.",movie
610,"The remake is infinitely more entertaining if you haven't seen Nine Queens -- the details are different, but the surprises are the same and something of the first film's underlying darkness has been lost in translation.",movie
611,"Maybe watching Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal is quite enough entertainment value for any movie.",movie
612,The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.,movie
613,"The fast, forced plot, which moves up from street grifts to a big score involving rare currency, lives in the amusing and zippered byplay of Luna and Reilly, who achieve a sort of marriage du jour for criminal purposes.",movie
614,"It's a good film, suitably entertaining, but there's the nagging question of why everyone bothered.",movie
615,"In the end, coincidence undoes Criminal.",movie
616,Those unfamiliar with Fabian Bielinsky's 2002 film will delight to this delicious deviousness.,movie
617,"The constant shadow of doubt keeps the viewer from investing in the characters, because we suspect one or more of them isn't what they seem.",movie
618,"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike.",movie
619,"Doesn't exactly reinvigorate an overworked genre, but neither does it disgrace the format or the original movie.",movie
620,"It's such a pleasure being in the company of these actors as they work with character-rich material that if they burst into the audience and swindled us out of our wallets, we would gladly oblige.",movie
621,"It's a listless, dutiful affair -- a cover version played out of obligation, not inspiration.",movie
622,"Its spiral of deceptions within deceptions remains resolutely character-based until the outlandish end, which proves emotionally satisfying because it's based on what really drives people as much as too-clever plotting.",movie
623,An incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams.,movie
624,The disparity between Richard and Rodrigo is too great and the impossible coincidences of the ending are too far-fetched.,movie
625,This is the kind of movie so full of coincidence and double crosses that you simply don't have the mental energy to go back and sort it all out at the end.,movie
626,"Some snappy dialogue, fine performances and lots of shady atmosphere give Criminal a tasty B-movie flavor.",movie
627,"What elevates Criminal into a delicious con in the league of Red Rock West, House of Games or Matchstick Men is John C. Reilly.",movie
628,"Follows the original fairly closely, and because I already knew the plot secrets, it couldn't work on me in its intended way. As the recycled characters, dialog and events turned up, there seemed to be an echo in the room.",movie
629,"Glances at family dynamics and class divisions benefit the genre mix, and the cast animates the lean script with a simmering brew of charm, smarm, ferocious greed and street smarts.",movie
630,Reilly sheds a career playing dupes and schlubs and gives his first full-tilt electric performance.,movie
631,Scores higher than most con artist movies by focusing more on the artists than the con.,movie
632,Criminal has a wonderful modern film noir feel punctuated with incredibly clever dialog...,movie
633,It has half the panache and none of the surprise for anyone who saw the original.,movie
634,"It's funny, fast-paced, and sharp - as entertaining in English as it was in Spanish.",movie
635,This remake of 'Nine Queens' is just as absorbing for those who did not see the original.,movie
636,Criminal can be praised and damned for its fidelity to the Argentinean masterpiece Nine Queens.,movie
637,"If subtitles are not your thing and you're in the mood to witness an elegant con job in the classic Mamet mold, then Criminal is the card to play.",movie
638,"A competent Americanization of the Argentinian film ""Nine Queens,"" with John C. Reilly seemingly enjoying his atypical leading role.",movie
639,"even when the emotional aspect of the story starts to work, it is ultimately undermined by a final twist",movie
640,Not smooth or seductive enough to coerce you into taking it at face value.,movie
641,Like dj vu all over again.,movie
642,"Maybe I'm dense, but the finale of Criminal left me not exactly sure what was won and what was lost or why I should care.",movie
643,"With dashes of black humour and pointed glimpses of the American class system, Criminal is a taut con-versus-con game whose deft artistry isn't fully revealed until the last few minutes.",movie
644,"A kind of who-done-what? puzzle. You'll probably enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the 2002 Argentine film, Nine Queens.",movie
645,"You can't go too far wrong on the performance front with John C. Reilly, Diego Luna or Maggie Gyllenhaal, but this one never really goes above average.",movie
646,Yet another inexplicable American remake that adds nothing new to the original.,movie
647,The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.,movie
648,"A jazzy, offhandedly brilliant exercise in colorful mendacity and shell game shenanigans that benefits from the cool, authoritative occupational swagger of John C. Reilly.",movie
649,This is one of the best con movies I have seen as rare currency is used as the valuable commodity.,movie
650,"Like a smash-and-grab job, the movie gets in, springs the con and gets out quick - leaving the viewer to replay the twists on his or her own time.",movie
651,"While the twists at the end are a little more predictable here than in the first film, it's still an assured work, especially considering that it comes from a first-time director.",movie
652,Redundant.,movie
653,"It isn't quite as witty or gritty as Nine Queens, but if you didn't see that film, then see it now that it's in English.",movie
654,Well acted and intriguing...,movie
655,Reilly is perhaps the most amazing fusion of boy and man we have in American movies.,movie
656,... a fairly straightforward remake of the Argentine hit Nine Queens (2000),movie
657,"Considerando-se que o timo Nove Rainhas foi realizado h apenas alguns anos, esta refilmagem soa desnecessria, por mais interessante que seja seu roteiro.",movie
658,"...the interaction of the movie's two leads, Reilly and Luna, is so good you might enjoy it for their performances alone.",movie
659,"[It's] a safer, watered-down, but still enjoyable redo.",movie
660,A second-generation photocopy of a David Mamet cryptogram.,movie
661,"Con film aficionados won't find the picture revolutionary, but even they should enjoy the structure, craftsmanship and a nice supporting performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.",movie
662,Those viewers who watched NUEVE REINAS beforehand will be affected with increasingly unpleasant feeling of deja vu.,movie
663,"Like Richard Widmark, [John C. Reilly] is an excellent character actor who can convey both likeability and pathetical desperation simultaneously.",movie
664,This con man movie is best for older teens and up.,movie
665,A witless high-concept action film that's forgettable.,movie
666,"Filmmaker Gregory Jacobs, making his debut here, delivers an opening half hour that's perhaps not as compelling as it could (or should) have been...",movie
667,There's nothing stars John C. Reilly and Diego Luna can do to make you forget you're watching the same story.,movie
668,There's more than enough weird and wise material to keep you entertained -- especially if you're an animation buff or a Samuel Clemens aficionado.,movie
669,Dry humor and scary scenes abound in Twain overview.,movie
670,Such a wonderfully entertaining and rather charming film.,movie
671,"A nice piece of work, but unfortunately it smacks of bandwagon-jumping following the success of such docs as Winged Migration.",movie

682,"It's not always pretty, but it's a shining of example of nature at its most brutal and beautiful.",movie
683,The film keeps facts and figures to a minimum and lets the breathtaking images (underscored by George Fenton's sometimes bombastic score) carry the show.,movie
684,"Deep Blue is a beautiful movie, nicely scored and elegantly shot. But it's all about as thrilling as a good aquarium.",movie
685,It's about half an hour too long and Pierce Brosnan's sonorous narration threatens to lull us to sleep on those rocking waves.,movie
686,A beautiful but empty-headed documentary about the creatures that lurk in the sea.,movie
687,"It may not actually be comprehensive, but it feels like Deep Blue touches on all the points worth knowing, and more just for fun.",movie
688,"Deep Blue isn't as fortunate with screen dimensions, but it works, if only because it's hard to deny the vast beauty and mysteries that lie in our abyssal oceans.",movie
689,"These iridescent oddities are pure science fiction, and they gave the grade-schooler in me a good 'Whoa!'",movie
690,"Even with consistently impressive camerawork, the movie still feels like the visual equivalent of elevator music -- with frolicking dolphins instead of Elton John ballads.",movie
691,"A better action movie than most of what you'll see this summer, and there are certainly more visceral thrills.",movie
692,"It goes on a little too long for mostly just pretty pictures, and you get more wonder than educational detail, but it's fascinating to look at.",movie
693,"Documentary about the ocean's panorama of life is full of beauty, awe, terror, wonder -- and jaw-dropping cinematography.",movie

766,"Bypasses the mythic tone of Richard Wagner's opera...without forsaking storybook romance. The inoffensive results get the job done, but sadly fail to excite.",movie
767,Everything is a little too overdone.,movie

778,"A tepid, tinny modernist recasting of the epic romance...something like a WB Network twentysomething soap opera in medieval dress.",movie
779,"Tristan & Isolde does nothing to help further the cause of historic epics. In fact, it may even go down in flames faster than you can say ""Orlando Bloom was horribly miscast in Kingdom of Heaven.""",movie
780,"The film gives off the feeling of being incredibly bored with itself. The feeling, sadly, is contagious.",movie
781,"Even though the time period has been brilliantly captured, it's too long and lacks pace. Even so, against all odds, I liked it. Many in my audience seemed to have a different opinion, laughing at lines that did not invite laughter.",movie
782,This couple has endured for over 900 years; the least Tristan & Isolde can do is show us a reason why.,movie
783,The end result plays out like a George Lucas film without spaceships and lightsabers.,movie
784,"The movie plods around, appears to pick up speed, but then falters. Worse, we never feel true sympathy for the lovers who are forced to risk all to meet in secret when fate and politics keep them apart.",movie
785,"While Tristan & Isolde, a competent but uninspired film version of the legendary medieval romance, will likely fade from theaters and memories quickly, Myles' lovely face and spirited performance should linger.",movie
786,We don't find a tale of transcendent passion but rather of two vain nitwits in a case of routine attraction.,movie
787,"Reynolds' film has an evocative, old-fashioned storybook look (as if designed by N.C. Wyeth or Aubrey Beardsley), and features strong performances.",movie
788,"Filmed in breathtaking locations in Western Ireland and the Czech Republic, Tristan & Isolde is a disappointingly passion-free romance.",movie
789,"[Director Reynolds] has a feel for the rough beauty of western England and the Irish coast, and he moves quickly, if not always coherently, through battles and cabals.",movie
790,"The story itself -- Tristan falls in love with Isolde first, only to see her married off as part of a cold-hearted peace treaty -- is merely dreary, full of overwrought villainy and thuggish jousting.",movie
791,"Trying to underplay things, the actors practically sleepwalk. When someone finally gets the chance to shout, 'Seize him!' he does so with as much gusto as the guy who says, 'WINS news time: 8:45.'",movie
792,It's that rare movie that had me wishing I was at the opera.,movie
793,"Tristan & Isolde is deadly serious, straightforward and surprisingly entertaining tragedy that reinforces much of what we think we know about the Dark Ages in Britain.",movie
794,Reynolds has again delivered a lavish adventure for audiences who like their entertainment earnest and their storytelling straightforward.,movie
795,This whole movie feels so wrong that you're likely to develop a headache from all the eye rolling.,movie
796,"It's all nicely shot, but Tristan And Isolde lacks the soul that has kept this story alive for a thousand-+ years.",movie
797,There's far more smiting than smooching -- more hewing of limbs than heaving of bosoms.,movie
798,"Sorry, no magic here.",movie
799,"Tristan & Isolde strives to be the good old-fashioned medieval kind of romance that stirs the soul. But due to the somewhat lackluster performances from the doomed young lovers, the film doesn't quite hit the mark.",movie
800,Don't get out your handkerchiefs. You won't need them for Tristan & Isolde ... a fatal flaw in a movie that purports to recount the original star-crossed-lovers myth.,movie
801,"In the end, Tristan & Isolde is never painful. It's just a bit of a dull blade.",movie
802,This Tristan is strictly for those who prefer their romantic melodrama bloodied up a bit.,movie
803,"Unlike the opera, this version of the tale features no mystical elements and comes off as horribly contrived. What's more, director Kevin Reynolds' sluggish pacing makes the film feels twice as long as it really is.",movie
804,Franco looks appropriately troubled as Tristan. Myles is pretty and sweet enough to win hearts as Isolde.,movie
805,"They are hollow people mooning their way through a backdrop of endless battles in which wild-haired, wild-eyed men chop each other about.",movie
806,"The fate of two nations hinges on the nondisclosure of the stolen kisses and secret trysts. But, boy, could I have not cared less.",movie
807,"No, Tristan & Isolde goes nowhere, does nothing and only succeeds at making an audience want for a more that never comes.",movie
808,... a hard film to watch unless you bring your own pre-existing fascination with the material.,movie
809,Suffers from a contemporary take on a very period piece.,movie
810,"The longer the film ran, the more I wanted to be put out of Tristan and Isolde's misery.",movie
811,"Rather than complementing and intensifying the love story, a parallel tale of raging medieval war only interrupts the action. Alas, our love for this movie is one that can never be.",movie
812,"[""Tristan & Isolde""] is trying to be both chick flick and machismo movie. I'm not sure it does either well enough but it is a showcase for Sophia Myles.",movie
813,"There are serious ideas at work here. But in these hands, it's as shallow and glossed-over as Franco's English accent.",movie
814,"one of those rare cinematic experiences that feels whole, that feels authentic.",movie
815,"A sweeping, heartfelt tale, beautifully told, that works on multiple levels.",movie
816,"In short, it's just not fun with the specter of tragedy looming over every scene.",movie
817,"Across the board, it's far from special.",movie
818,"I can wholeheartedly recommend Tristan & Isolde, even to those who don't have a penchant for period piece romances. The movie has a lot to offer.",movie
819,Yes! it's a story of love at first sight which will ring down the ages. But everyone seems bored with the whole nonsense.,movie
820,Stolen moments from other films abound but director Kevin Reynolds has clearly given the story and characters a life and identity of their own.,movie
821,The movie lacks style and pacing; Franco and Myles look too contemporary. They would be more at home with their romantic problems on some Fox or WB drama ...,movie
822,"Arthur Reinhart's stunning images repeatedly isolate Isolde among the cool, gray expanse of natural settings. She's a freethinking woman at the mercy of powerful forces beyond her control, trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time in history.",movie
823,"A serious, old-fashioned, history-heavy romance.",movie
824,"Do we really want less magic in our legends? And if these stories are stripped of their mythic aspects, are they even very interesting anymore?",movie
825,"A handsomely assembled non-musical version of the legend ... the chinks in the armor creep in with James Franco, all lathered up in a weepy soap opera performance.",movie
826,"It has action and intrigue, diabolic plots, a tournament of champions, and everything else you would expect from a medieval movie, but it has a tendency to over tell the story and needs more romance.",movie
827,The film's roots and execution are faithful to the source and allow the emotional and thematic complexity of the tale to shine through.,movie
828,"A poignant, old-fashioned, history-heavy forbidden romance",movie
829,"The legend of ""Tristan & Isolde"" happened a long time ago, so the story goes. And here it's retold as an average film that could have been worse, but could have been better, for the resume of director Kevin Reynolds.",movie
830,"The movie attempts a sort of documentary realism in depicting a period that is largely undocumented %u2026 but as was the case with the flat-footed King Arthur of two years ago, you may miss the magic.",movie
831,...never out-and-out boring...,movie
832,Much more A Knight's Tale than Romeo & Juliet,movie
833,A legendary love story set amidst violent clashes between English warlords and an Irish king fails to impress.,movie
834,"Frequently rubbish but nonetheless enjoyable swashbuckler, despite a tendency to take itself a bit too seriously. More fun than King Arthur.",movie
835,"Swords clank, star-crossed lovers yearn, yadda yadda yadda.",movie
836,"Fans of historical epics will find much to like in the costuming, battle sequences and cinematography, but the love story itself is underdeveloped.",movie
837,"The two leads, James Franco and Sophia Myles, generate a modicum of chemistry, despite being penned in by a clunky script.",movie
838,A compelling story washed down for a film that's likely only appeal to pre-teen girls.,movie
839,"Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.",movie
840,"By removing the sorcery and operatic excess so synonymous with the story, the filmmakers conjure an affecting, pretty melodrama... with the emphasis more on mellow than drama.",movie
841,A strong visual style and a violent streak only partially undone by the PG-13 rating.,movie
842,"The production is grimy and listless, without any color to be seen, literal or figurative -- not even those little red dots meant to deter piracy. But then, there's not much danger of that.",movie
843,"Funciona principalmente graÃ§as Ã  maneira eficaz com que retrata o amor do casal-tÃ­tulo, que jamais deixa de soar convincente.",movie
844,"A movie in which all necessities are captured in two hours of ambitious celluloid, except for one critical anchoring piece: a heart.",movie
845,"one of those movies you keep in that special shelf, to watch them when you're ready to kill yourself, just to make sure you made the right decision",movie
846,"Tristan & Isolde isn't the sort of film you'd go out of your way for, but you could certainly do a lot worse.",movie
847,No Wagner libretto and not much depth or soul.,movie
848,[Tristan and Isolde] moves so sluggishly that someone must have been dosing the cast and crew with Nyquil.,movie
849,"The performances are all raw and natural, and they are filmed in a close-up and often very intimate way.",movie
850,"Welcome to the world of film festival cinema. We hope you enjoy your stay, or at least don't fall asleep in the next hour and a half.",movie
851,"The primary impression is lots of moping and mooning, + a song at the beginning with some of the worst lyrics you've ever heard.",movie
852,"The collage of poetic visual asides and emotional exchanges courts effusiveness, but it remains earnest and hauntingly expressive of an inner human turmoil.",movie
853,"Stony and statuesque, Michelini is an excellent casting choice: Her impassive face and dispassionate voice serve as a carefully constructed protective mask that hides her pain, and which she rarely lets slip.",movie
854,"Viewers are either going to walk out after 10 minutes or, like this tolerant critic, get caught up in the sordid lives of the three misfits and stick around for the ambiguous ending.",movie
855,"The film explains why Stphanie and her bisexual boyfriends need each other, but doesn't depict why they are drawn to each other, making the mnage  trois mechanical.",movie
856,Lyrical yet succinct.,movie
857,A weirder mnage  trois you will never encounter.,movie
858,For what the film had to work with -- a thin script -- it flawlessly achieved what it set it out to do.,movie
859,"Amid all the discussion of crust and sauce and the proper consistency of each, A Tale of Two Pizzas lays on the cheese way too thick.",movie
860,"There is some trite Italian-American stereotypes on display, and the interstitial animated sequences have nothing to do with the plot and drag down this otherwise sprightly comedy.",movie
861,"Any way you slice it, A Tale of Two Pizzas is so ineptly written and directed that it's pretty soggy entertainment.",movie
862,"Though it bears absolutely no relation to real life, this sweetly silly modern fairy tale possesses just enough charm to endear itself to secret sentimentalists.",movie

878,genuinely clunky,movie
879,Writer/director Wayne Kramer's approach to storytelling is to withhold any information that might give away the plot. The film is a string of violent confrontations between characters whose relationships to each other are unclear.,movie
880,A potential howler done in by a tendency to wear too much body tissue on its sleeve.,movie
881,"In the gleefully violent Running Scared, the writer and director Wayne Kramer tries to go over the rainbow and put a self-consciously bloody spin on once upon a time.",movie
882,"With a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity, Running Scared displays a reckless intensity.",movie
883,"The hallucinatory crime thriller Running Scared, written and directed by Wayne Kramer, is pretty awful.",movie
884,"Running Scared goes so far over the top, it circumnavigates the top and doubles back on itself; it's the Mobius Strip of over-the-topness. I am in awe.",movie
885,"If Running Scared sometimes looks like a storyboard sprung violently to life, Kramer's assured direction turns that into its greatest strength in the clinches, of which there are plenty.",movie
886,It's like a gruesome merry-go-round filled with unpleasant characters and bad acting.,movie
887,"Luciano Pavarotti's eyebrows during the Olympic opening ceremonies were disturbing. Multiply that by about 1,000, and you have the creep-out factor in the gory Running Scared.",movie
888,"If it's possible to admire his movie's heedless energy, it's also possible to hate its guts.",movie
889,This is the kind of movie where character development consists of a guy mentioning in passing he has a meth lab in his back yard.,movie
890,"If Running Scared were set in Hell (the actual place, rather than a figure of speech), perhaps it would have been easier to swallow.",movie
891,"A spinning-plates movie that only makes a shattered-glass mess in its finale with one twist for each character left standing. Otherwise, this empty-calorie eye-candy cartoon is an ultraviolent, boot-on-throat thiller with style and humor.",movie
892,"Running Scared keeps ratcheting up the intensity, but to what end?",movie
893,"Ethnic stereotyping, moral qualms and plot improbabilities aside, you just wish a movie like Running Scared wasn't so anxious to be exciting all the time: It gets so monotonous.",movie
894,The only things more abundant than gunshot-riddled corpses are the ridiculous plot twists and the laughably bad lines of dialog...it's likely to be the most fun at a bad movie you'll have for a while.,movie
895,"The clunky happily-ever-after ending is a bit too nicey-nice but with all of the wall-to-wall action, ultra-violent gunplay and over-the-top writing it is an amusing ride.",movie
896,"There's clearly supposed to be tension between Joey's good and bad sides. Sure, he's a mobster, but he's also a family man, which makes him... gray. (Not black and white = very sophisticated.)",movie

898,"In the opening minutes of Running Scared, a drug deal goes bad and takes the entire movie with it.",movie
899,"It's way too violent and perversely excessive for many tastes, but there's more to its outrages than meets the eye, and that second look is well worth taking.",movie
900,"There is a child at the center of this ultraviolent story, and the devices used to keep us on tenterhooks regarding his survival are appallingly manipulative.",movie
901,"Let me be clear. I'm not saying I liked Running Scared from the get-go or for all the way through, start to finish, but I did like it all the same.",movie
902,"Running Scared is for people who like movies, who don't need to have a movie mean something in order to enjoy it and who can delight at the sheer craft of a story designed only to shock, amuse and hold an audience.",movie
903,"For a moment, it appears as if Running Scared has developed into a different, better movie. But subsequent gratuitously violent scenes hint at a determination by Kramer to keep his film at low-grade exploitation level.",movie
904,It's hard to believe that this mess was made by the same man who made The Cooler.,movie
905,"It's borderline irresponsible, a virtual horror movie of a gangster thriller.",movie
906,"It's ridiculous, over-the-top and as allegorical as The Warriors, in its own twisted way, only far more convoluted and darkly funny. And it's probably the year's first action movie spurred by actual, provocative ideas.",movie
907,"Kramer seems to be aping Quentin Tarantino's brilliant tangents in Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't have Tarantino's imagination or gift for dialogue.",movie
908,This overlong fantasy of urban violence is so far over the top -- you might as well be watching a computer monitor while somebody else has a high time playing the video game Grand Theft Auto.,movie
909,"Running Scared is a vicious and brutal B-movie jacked up to hysterical, hallucinatory proportions -- a pulpy, violent action picture that torments the viewer as much as its characters, and I mean that as a compliment.",movie
910,"With a herky-jerky visual style and a plot riddled with bullet holes, Running Scared is a brutal, misanthropic and downright nasty excuse for bang-bang entertainment.",movie
911,"As the movie becomes more howlingly ludicrous by the second, it's tempting -- and not in a cynical way, either -- to start reading it as a parody of pornographic video game violence.",movie
912,Kramer's grating bombast exists only to call attention to itself as well as the complete absence of any moral implications or recognizable human behavior in the film.,movie
913,"The script is so stupid that at times you'll want to roll your eyes in the dark; you won't, though, because you might miss some of the action.",movie
914,"But even beyond its sleazy pandering and sensationalism, the film's worst transgression is its exploitation of young children.",movie
915,"It drags on and on and on and on...and on. We never thought we'd ever say this, but Paul Walker deserves better.",movie
916,"An exhilarating bloodbath of a film, Running Scared may not be perfect, but it's got adrenaline, wild eyes and sleaze to spare.",movie
917,...an abhorrently exploitative exercise in child endangerment.,movie
918,You could laugh off the film's more over-the-top aspects -- including the performances and its quasi-Quentin Tarantino dialogue -- if it didn't treat women and children with such brutality and contempt.,movie
919,Running Scared is not only toxic but irresponsible in the way it exposes young characters to a steady barrage of sleaze and violence.,movie
920,"Running Scared is about as hard an ""R"" rating as you can get, with buckets of blood, full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk.",movie
921,Running Scared will be reviled by those who deplore violence and adored by those who like their movies brutally edgy.,movie
922,"Running Scared will probably play best in prisons, where lowlifes, applauding the heroic amounts of foul language and blood, will be heartened to know that society has finally stooped to their level.",movie
923,"A depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that, with its gassy style and runaway immorality, makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture.",movie
924,"Too bloated with its own seriousness to achieve the 'so sick, it's funny' vibe of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.",movie
925,Includes scenes that are laughable [gunfight in a 10x10 room] and one that features Vera Farmiga that will go down in history as a classic/fan favorite.,movie
926,"For a picture so fetishistically obsessed with death, Running Scared is vibrantly alive.",movie
927,"Impossible to adequately summarize, alienating at every tonal turn, off the rails with every storytelling and aesthetic choice, Running Scared is ambitious to a fault.",movie
928,"Running Scared is an overly ambitious guilty pleasure with enough action and violence to keep you interested, it just doesn't have much else.",movie
929,"This is a movie with yards and yards of plot, but none of it that makes much sense nor that you'll think about afterwards. Instead what you'll remember is the blood.",movie

1000,"I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.",book
1001,"Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of ""thou shalts"" is worth the price of the book.The description of various ""personalities"" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.",book
1002,"I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!",book
1003,"I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!",book
1004,"I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry.",book
1005,"I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt.",book
1006,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",book
1007,When I first read this the I was mezmerized at the style of writting. I soon became so hooked on this book that I wanted to fall on my knees and shut out the rest of the world. Haddon delivers a portrayal of a woman that is hurt loney and abused and I think she does a wonderful job making the reader feel like the character.,book
1008,"I read the review directly under mine and I have to say I laughed. How can someone write a honest review on a book they read only three pages of? That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it.",book
1009,"I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of ""adults"" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.",book
1010,"This was not a typical romance read. It is deep, loving and full of suspense. This book touches on wemon's issues and it caresses the heart. By the third chapter I was hooked. I did not think the first chapted was too long. It was great. I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who wants a great read.",book
1011,"I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story.",book
1012,"I loved this book for a few reasons. The first was that I felt as if I was not reading the story, but I was part of the story. I loved the way it twisted and turned at every corner, I loved that I simply did not know what to expect. The choice of words was spectacular and just when I thought that I was in control of my own emotions, something would jump up and surprise me. I am anxiously waiting for the next book, this was one of the best romance suspense books that I have read in years. I highly recomend it. I give this one five stars !!!!!!!!",book
1013,"I thought this book was brilliant. The plot was so good that it kept me guessing until the end. It worked its way into my heart and I can't help every now and then thinking about Maxwell, Heath and Julia.

1014,"I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!",book
1015,"This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable.",book
1016,"I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway. I have to say I love it. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in two hours. I say buy it. I say read it. It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today. We spend too much time looking at the faults of others. I also enjoyed beloved.Sincerly,Jaylynn R",book

1018,"I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!",book
1019,"I am an avid reader and I was shocked at how hooked I became on this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long and a little too discriptive, but truth be told after that I could not put this down. I read the other reviews on Whispers of the wicked saints before I wrote this and I saw one bad review that was written by someone who admitedly did not read this book. Don't take the advice of the ignorant, this book is an absolute must for romance fans. I give it five stars !!",book
1020,"This book was very discriptive and I actually found myself involved in the lives of the characters. If you ever get a chance to read this book, please do! I have found that the beginning of the book was a little too discriptive, but push through. The best is yet to come. You will definately find yourself wanting more. There was some parts in the book that made me HOT!! Veronica had a way with describing the places and the characters. I could actually see this story as if it were an actual movie. I really loved this book. If you are a romantic at heart and you love a great outcome, you must read Whispers of the Wicked Saints. GREAT, GREAT story!!",book
1021,"I happen to love romance novels, but only if they are goos romance. I am not one who loves everything, but this made my heart rejoice. I absolutlely could not put it down. Wow what a book !! You have to read this awesome story of forbiden love. I warn you now. It is steamy.",book
1022,"This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night.",book
1023,"This is a wonderful book that will keep you guessing. It is Rare to find a book that will make you laugh and cry at the same time and still leave you wondering what will happen next. What was even more amazing about it, is the fact that it is written in such a poetic way. This is a rare find and I look forward to the next book written by Veronica Haddon.",book
1024,"Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week.",book
1025,"I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.",book
1026,Normally I'm not much into romance stories but I absolutely loved this book. This book had the right kind of suspense that made it impossible to put down. Kept me wondering what would happen right up until the end. Loved it! I am looking for anything else this author puts out.,book
1027,"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",book
1028,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",book
1029,"I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel.",book
1030,"It has been years since I've read a romance novel. If this is typical of the genre these days, I will never pick up another one. Not only is the plot contrived and juvenile, the writing shows the lack of skill expected only in a child's writing. Many of my seventh grade writing students would be embarrassed if this trash was attributed to them. ""The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him."" Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction. Perhaps by the time she graduates from college she will have gained an understanding of good sentence construction, proper punctuation, and the value of using adjectives sparingly. And if she reads a great deal along the way, she might also learn how to construct a plausible plot.",book
1031,"It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?",book
1032,"I really enjoyed this book, sure this author is just starting out, but I still really liked it. How many books have the reviewers that hated this book wrote and got published? I read a lot, and I always have. I don't usually like modern love stories, but I gave it a chance and found that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I look forward to reading her next book and no I'm not a family member or a friend. Just give her book a chance and you might just find that it really is pretty good.",book
1033,"I loved this little book, I thought the first chapter was a little long, but even though it was long I loved it. This writer is a 3D writer. Her words make you feel as if you are the character and I loved that. This is a first novel for Veronica, and I am forever a fan !!",book
1034,I can not talk this book up enough. It was well writen and a major page turner. It was a book about a pastor that falls for a member of his congregation. It will leave your heart full and your mind pondering question of infidelity and what is right and wrong and where God draws the line. It is a must read.,book
1035,"I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!",book
1036,"from publisher:Addresses the interplay of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural traditions across the Caribbean.Dealing with the ongoing interaction of rich and diverse cultural traditions from Cuba and Jamaica to Guyana and Surinam, Nation Dance addresses some of the major contemporary issues in the study of Caribbean religion and identity. The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of ""nations"" across the waters.",book
1037,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.",book
1038,Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!,book
1039,This book is a continual resource. It is so biblical and so simple. Dr. Ferguson's candid honesty is transparent to the bright shining light of Christ's words for His glorious Church.,book

He raised the dead, walks on water, fled the invading Tatars from a Cathedral carrying a 500 lb. Statue. All thoughout he dispenses his own brand of spiruatilty and humility.

1042,"Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf.",book
1043,"Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language.While Dramatica is a powerful tool for building a story, it is complex and sometimes overwhelming. Armando Salda&ntilde;a-Mora found a way to demystify Dramatica and give a lot of practical advices and principles for creating a story with Dramatica.""Dramatica for Screenwriters"" is easy to understand, fun and thought-provoking. The only drawback is that this book is not useful if you do not know the Dramatica Theory or do not use Dramatica software. Now, if you're a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have.",book
1044,"I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it ""demystifies"" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it.",book
1045,"Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn. The main book is dense, repetitive, dilatory and slow. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS is the opposite! The writing flows easily. It's directs you to the easiest possible paths for getting started. It encourages you to take action and walks you through it. It provides good theoretical guidance without getting bogged down.This is the book that should come with the software for everyone, not just screenwriters. It gives anyone who reads it the ability to jump into A STORY and get it done. Once you've gotten A STORY done you can use Dramatica to alter it for it's media (you may need the main book to get you there). You can also get more stories done with it. Dramatica is not intuitive software. You need to use it from a number of angles to get the hang of it. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS gets you there. The main Dramatica book doesn't. READ THIS BOOK FIRST.",book
1046,"I think the hardest thing for people coming to Dramatica the first time is understanding that the theory and software are not designed to write your story for you (or tell you what your story is about), but rather to tell you, based on the way you answer all the hundreds of questions, what the best storyform or context is from which to tell your story in the way you want.[...]I did the work to know the theory, but ""Dramatica for Screenwriters"" really helped me understand it. Even though I am a fiction writer and not a screenwriter, I found that most of this book applies to any kind of fictional world building.

It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty.",book

1055,"If you are someone who is fairly new to the law school admissions process and haven't done much research on what it takes to get into law school, this information might seem very helpful and insightful to you. However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide.",book
1056,"Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.",book
1057,"My advisor never asked any of the right questions or gave me the kind of information that would have helped me with my plan to study law. While looking for books on the LSAT I found this book and it really helped. It told me everything that the best advisor would have told me.

I feel really good about my applications and think I have a really good chance of getting a ""big envelope"".",book

It let me know that even though I'm not the best student, there are plenty of schools that I would definitly get in to, and it told me how to make my application the best it could possibly be. I am sure that I would have gotten into at least a couple of the schools I had picked to apply to. However, lucky for me, before I sent in my applications I decided to read the book again. This time I started with the first chapter &quot;Should I go to law school.&quot; Guess what? Being a lawyer isn't what I thought it was! I mean, this book told me things about what lawyers personal lives are like, and what their average work day is like... stuff that I had never gotten anywhere else! This chapter convinced me that I would not be happy being a lawyer! Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn't right for me at all!

1061,"Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary.

(From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book!

1068,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five.

All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues.

1074,"I recommend this book highly. I have a competitor's text also and while it is useful, I appreciate the format of Beginner's Yoruba which is interactive. The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday!

I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase ""O'ngbiyanju"" is priceless!",book
1075,"This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.",book
1076,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf",book

The author should have spent more time examining the different types of tools and the qualities of each type. The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design. They do not reproduce as well as disigns I have found in other books.Overall I found the book informative and the designs excellent.",book

1086,"Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can't you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson",book
1087,"This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!",book
1088,"When I first picked up the book, Communicating with Orcas by Mary Getten, I was mildly interested in learning about Orca whales. After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing",book
1089,"This is well worth the read if only to gain information about the pods of Orcas that are resident around the San Juan Islands. But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity.",book
1090,"Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch",book
1091,"I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we ""Michiganders"" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a ""far away"" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a ""bunch of nonsense"" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think ""What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life"" I highly recommend this book to all!!",book
1092,"I LOVED Mary Getten's book ""Communicating with Orcas"". I couldn't put it down. Reading it, my sense of life's inter-connectedness was profoundly deepened. After I read this book I looked at all life with new eyes and a new heart.I was touched by Getten's love and respect for the Orcas and her courage to share this information with the world. I mean, where else are you going to learn about, among other things, whale sex from their perspective!!!? Her conversations with Granny made me laugh at times, cry at others. They changed me.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and find myself lending out my copy frequently. Reading this book fosters a new reverence for life. Sharing this book with others is one way I work to bring healing to the earth.",book
1093,"i guess there are still come people out there who feel that telepathic communication with animals is impossible. They must not live with pets! I live with 3 dogs and i KNOW we communicate. One thing that is great about this book is that Mary Getten is a scientist, and brings that objectivity to her studies of the orcas. She enlists another communicator, Raphaela Pope, so that they can confirm each other's information. I found this book to be a very well-rounded piece of scientific journalism, they interviewed their subjects on many different topics to present an in-depth view of life from a whales's perpective. I haven't spent much time with whales but this book was a great introduction, probably the best!!",book

1096,"I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.",book

1102,"Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American. By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards.",book
1103,"This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]",book

The book should be read by those interested in a first hand view of the civil war as seen through the eyes of an ordinary man (2nd in command under Chamberlain). It provides great insight into what daily life was like during the war. I found this book to be extremely moving...it made me proud of as well as grateful to those that lived through conditions most of us could never even imagine.",book
1114,"John J. Pullen, in his seminal work ""The Twentieth Maine"" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to ""take the convervative view of men and events."" Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel ""Killer Angels"" and in the movie ""Gettysburg."" Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts.""Recollections"" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times.",book

1116,"I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a ""good day"". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the ""I know"" , ""Nice try"" and ""I love you too much to argue"". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!!",book
1117,"I've given this book to quite a few people. Basically, here's what I got out of this book:It's loving to let your children experience the consequences of their own actions. You WANT your children to become strong, responsibly adults--so you need to let them develop the skills they need to succeed on their own.You also want to do so in a way that is LOVING and not coming across as punishing or the bad guy. It's such a tricky act. But once you learn this (and you'll find it VERY successful) you can apply it to your children, your SPOUSE, and your COWORKERS!",book
1118,"I am a big fan of Love and Logic and have several of the books already. I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun! I am also a teacher and these are great strategies! Wonderful supplement or stand alone book for Love and Logic!",book
1119,"Not sure what the other reader was talking about. I am an agnostic so I am pretty aware of that kind of thing. I was also a teacher. Not only does Love and Logic work in the classroom but it does amazing things with my kids. I have 2 toddlers and I think the Love and Logic books and videos are an indespensible resource. It seems to me that the previous reviewer was just looking for a forum to rant about something totally unrelated to these books. He also wasn't reviewing this book - I guess some people will actually mislead people to try and get their voice heard. If click on ""see my other reviews"" under his name you will see that he has reviewed every book in the Love and Logic series with this rhetoric that is based on complete ignorance. Charles Fay and Foster Cline (founders of Love and Logic) are from Evergreen Colorado - not Colorado Springs and have nothing to do with the whole ""family first"" thing. There is no affiliation whatsoever. Again, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - but it is a shame that he may turn people away from a resource that is the most effective tool I have come across to raise children who are responsible, able to make choices effectively, have great self-esteem, and to avoid all the arguments and power struggles that come with parenting.",book

I read this book a few years back when we were struggling and when she started to get involved with the wrong crowd. I saw her almost slip away. This book had a great impact on my parenting style and even though I am far from perfect, I applied and still apply a lot of the very simple techniques described in Jim Fays book to my every day parenting. It is a small book, easy read that captures the essence and equips you with all the parenting tools you need!

Jim Fay has really got some great ideas. And they work!! Even if you're not really ""In Crisis"" with your family or a specific member, this is good to get to 'be prepared'. And maybe if more parents used these ways early on then they would never get to the 'in crisis' stage - wouldn't that be great??!! The idea of this philosophy is to NOT make the parent the Bad Guy for punishing the kid. It puts it back on the kid - WHERE IT BELONGS!! They also have classes on this that you can take at schools taught by other parents and there are seminars by the authors of these books too.",book

I recently got this one for my son, and I don't care for this story much at all.First off, its about mom and dad going away on a trip. However they only address that issue once, and that's on the first page when mom and dad leave and it says that grandma and grandpa are watching them. They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing.",book
1136,"We love all the little critter books. They are always so colorful and fun to read. We also add a little more fun by trying to find the frog, spider and mouse on each page.

1145,"This is a very entertaining tale of a clever cyncial rabbi's cat on the surface. However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn't detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary.",book
1146,"This is a one-volume, hard-cover, adult graphic novel about a Rabbi's cat who gets the power to speak. This novel was originally published in France, in three volumes, spread over three years. It's a wonderful book.By the way, Joann is a guy's name, in France. Maybe, it's an old French spelling of John or Jean. According to the book's jacket blurb, Sfar is one of the ""brightest and most talented of the younger generation of French comic artists."" He has written or collaborated on over one hundred books for adults & children. Sfar received the prestigious Jury Award at Angouleme for The Rabbi's Cat.This book will be enlightening for most people & especially for most Jewish-Americans. The three connected stories are about Algerian Jews in the 1930s, in both Algeria & France. My knowledge of this area of Jewish life & history is negligible. IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn't pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book.",book
1147,"It is rare that I laugh out loud at a graphic novel but I was completely charmed by this book. The story is endearing, and the characters are like people you either know or would like to know. In some of the religious debates with the Rabbi's Rabbi, the cat is like Groucho Marx, reincarnated in a feline form.Beautifully illustrated, the Rabbi's Cat has, in my opinion, entered the pantheon of great cat characters, such as Krazy Kat, Puss in Boots, Fritz the Cat, and Catwoman, as played by Eartha Kitt.Warning: If you a totally serious person, with fixed views on religion, this book is not for you",book
1148,"Why is this book different from all other books?It is one of the most creative works I have read, whether in the category of ethnic fiction, graphic novels or books about animals. I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare ""sacrilegious magic"" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide ""Chabad houses"" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements.",book
1149,"As a Jewish American, I've always been fascinated by the experiences our people in the Diaspora. The lives of American, British, French, and Algerian Jews are all different. We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table). British Jews, respectively, make a greater effort to appear ""English"" while avoiding non-Jews. You won't see cockneys eating in Jewish delis (not that I saw any Jewish delis in London aside from Bloom's).The Rabbi's Cat has a very quirky story that's not easy to summarize. A scrawny cat gains the power of speech and engages his master, a Rabbi, in debates. The Rabbis gorgeous daughter, having no interest in philosophy (and having no work to do) loves this cat as if he were an irritating younger sibling.Zlabya is your typical Arabian-Nights-Fantasy though she happens to be Jewish. She marries a French Jew of Turkish origin, and some funny conflicts arise; he bores her, she feels self-conscious of her background, and her father isn't sure why the French Jews lack vitality. Or is he just too... full of life?I'm glad that graphic-novel fans will learn about the Jews of France thanks to this book. The Jews have been an important part of French society for years, but with the way things are going now, it may not last. Jews have been leaving France in greater number since 2001, and I hope they don't all leave for Israel, UK, or the USA. It would be a shame for France to lose such a great part of its culture.",book
1150,"This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird",book
1151,"I started going to the comic book store with my husband who's a life-long die-hard fan of all things related to comics, graphic novels, whatever you prefer to call them. Perusing on my own, I found The Rabbi's Cat, and lured by the art and a short preview, I bought both volumes. I ended up completely engrossed and read through them both in three nights.These books are for grown-ups, not children, although I understand Mr. Sfar also creates books for young readers. I love his drawings and panels. They're loose, energetic, rich in texture and color, and impart the feel of the settings and the life-force of the characters. The dialogue is lively and smart. There's a lot going on in these stories connected by the presence of The Cat. The story and environments change; sometimes the characters are excited and welcoming of the changes and sometimes not. I hated to see one story line end, but then the next one would pick up and I would be carried along by it engrossed and curious to see what happened next. It's a very human story set in a complex place and time. The characters struggle to keep their faith and balance in the midst of it all. They succeed, fail, learn, and are forged.And the cat is very, very true: smart, self-possessed, jealously devoted to his ""masters,"" and on equal or better intellectual footing compared to the human characters.",book

1159,"A widowed rabbi, his cat and his daughter live in Algeria spin a story and lesson in Judaism very cleverly crafted in this graphic novel. Through the cat, who having eaten the family parrot, is imparted a miraculous ability to speak, questions and challenges to the Jewish faith are presented to the rabbi and the rabbi's rabbi. First the cat lies about eating the parrot, and then he insists on learning the Kabbalah and wants a Bar Mitzvah.The rabbi's daughter gets married to a French rabbi and they honeymoon in Paris to meet with the in-laws. The widowed rabbi and the cat accompany them and the rabbi's faith is tested along the way, as well as his tolerance for those who don't practice the faith as he is believes it should be practiced.You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate this graphic novel. It's funny, sad and is a wonderful little theological study.",book
1160,"I didn't exactly like the look of the cat, though I have to admit a good resemblance to the artist's own pet.The story begins in Algeria. A rabbi's cat ate a parrot, and suddenly finds himself able to speak. To his master's consternation, the cat immediately begins to tell lies (""I didn't eat any parrot!"") The rabbi decides to educate him in the way of the Torah, and the cat insists he wants a Bar Mitzvah, and that by cat's age he is well past thirteen.The author cleverly works interesting questions about religion and culture into the story in a charming, humorous and witty way. There is a magic, a tenderness in the story telling. The cat looks a bit devilish in the beginning, but his unique view of things make for interesting narration. The rabbi character is so disarmingly endearing in his honesty, and his love for his cat and his daughter, it's impossible not to love him.",book
1161,Joann Sfar is a true master. This is a magical piece of work - so alive and full of color and character! I'd give it ten stars if i could!!,book
1162,"This book is absolutely delightful! It is a shear pleasure to read. It both makes you smile and think. It is both light and deep. It is a fitting testimony to the fact that a graphic novel is not just a comic book on steroids. So when you read it, do not forget to study the pictures closely.",book
1163,"Beautiful book! Joann Sfar wonderfully illustrates some classic questions about human identity, Jewish identity, the human condition, and the Jewish human condition. The humor is constantly refreshing, enhancing the depth of some philosophical episodes and keeping the tone simultaneously light and serious. I expect to read and reference this book often.",book
1164,this graphic novel does a great job of making common social issues in Africa easily understandable through the perspective of a cat. this graphic novel is complete with amazing illustrations from Sfar.,book
1165,"The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.",book
1166,"This book is great fun to read. The cat is a wonderful character, particularly when he is arguing theology and Talmud. I suspect if cats really could talk and argue theology, they'd act much like the one drawn in this book. In fact the book was inspired by the author's real cat (who doesn't speak, at least that I know of :-)) but apparently does understand how to keep his humans.This book can be enjoyed on several levels - as a fable about a cat and his humans, as a series of theological and philosophical debates, or just as a fun story about a talking cat and his adventures with his master.An important story element about midway through that the cat never figures out, but my wife did - it is an exchange, not a loss. This will make more sense after you've finished the book.One does not have to be Jewish or a scholar to appreciate the story and humor, but we gave a copy to our Rabbi as a gift and he loved it too. A couple more gift copies are planned too. Is that a positive endorsement or what?Parents of small children be warned - you might want to edit out the use of one bad word and some discussions of sexual topics.",book
1167,"What can I say? The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to ""get"" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to ""the rabbi's rabbi,"" where the cat informs him that:""I want to convert to Judaism. He asks me why.I tell him that if I am a good Jew, the rabbi will let me spend time with his daughter.I explain to him that the rabbi's daughter is my mistress.That I can't live without her, because she is my joy, and love is a beautiful thing.He tells me that my motives for converting to Judaism are unsatisfactory, that my love of God isn't sincere.I never said anything about love of God....He says that thinking of God fills even the grayest days with sunlight. He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn't have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out.""Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don't mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France. Don't be put off though; it's an easy, fun, and quick read. Sfar is immensely talented, and the sparse prose has been carefully thought out and apparently translates well. Don't miss this one!",book
1168,"This book works on many different levels. I feel that the main theme of this work is summed up in one panel, when the rabbi says, ""Blessed are thou, who allows us to transgress.""There is an underlying theme of bitterness in this book; the rabbi is widowed; the cat wants to become a bar-mitzvah, Paris has changed the rabbi's family, and the wonderful singer can only find work as a clown.The main story is that of a cat narrating the events in the lives of his owners, a rabbi and his daughter. When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language.",book
1169,"I stumbled upon this book while browsing in the world of graphic novels, where I rarely venture. They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was ""Will he be a Jew?"" And, more importantly, ""Will he be a good Jew?"" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular ""Persepolis"", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time.",book
1170,"I passed over The Rabbi's Cat repeatedly in the graphic novel section of my bookstore... the cover was a bit of a turn-off and the size is a bit cumbersome. I finally flipped through it at my library and checked it out. I'm beating myself up now for not reading this sooner! What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics.",book
1171,"""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a sometimes humorous, sometimes profound graphic novel about an unworldly rabbi, his daughter Zlabya and her cat in early 20th century Algeria, as told by the cat. The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the ""rabbi's rabbi"" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or ""cat"" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created ""in God's image""? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being ""the first Reconstructionist cat."" And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining ""talking animal"" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships. Caution to parents: This book contains brief nudity and some mature language and themes.",book
1172,"Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC.",book
1173,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.",book
1174,"Bad pun, I know, but perfectly apt for this wonderful book. ""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores.",book

1176,"This was a book club selection and, at first, I thought it was simply a comic book. Wrong. This is a charming, thought provoking little book that can be read at many different levels. No wonder my rabbi was the one who suggested that we read this. If you understand the basics of Judiasm, you'll get more out of this book. But even if you are not, you will be charmed by this fanciful tale.",book
1177,"""The Rabbi's Cat,"" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.",book
1178,"The artwork here was fantastic and original. At the back of the book there is a photograph of the author and his cat and you can clearly see where he gets his inspiration.Please be aware, though, that this book is not for children.",book
1179,"Many others have reviewed this material, better than I could. Suffice it to say, Sfar's work is consistently enjoyable, often provocative, and always entertaining. It may not be everybody's fruit (there is nudity, profanity, challenging topics... like life itself), but this is certainly among the best in graphic story-telling. Read and enjoy!",book
1180,"I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can't say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier"" than your average graphic novel",book
1181,"This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!",book
1182,Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels.

1183,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",book
1184,"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.",book
1185,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as &quot;nonsense.&quot; Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one.",book
1186,"John Malatich: the man, the philosophy, the legend. Perhaps only two of the three will suffice to describe this author his magnum opus: ""The Theory of Everything is..."". Unintentionally bizaare, Mr. Malatich expresses his philosophy in swarms of capital letters and misplaced parentheses that invite the reader to vainly delve deeper into the text to find the hidden meanings that are simply not there. Unlike the Codex Sepentarius or the Voynich Manuscript, this work does not use its own script; however, like those two, the inscrutbility of text and alien drawings lend an otherworldly note to the text.Though I'm giving this book a 3/5, do not think that I'm endorsing Mr. Malatich's ideas, as I find them puerile and easily refutable by even the untrained eye. However, taken as a sort of 'art' , this book stands as a brazen testament to the American kook: those who willingly and unabashedly ignore reality in preference to living within its confines.",book

The section on Solomon is the same as I've read in at least 2 other of his books. This series is probably a guilty pleasure to scholars who aren't allowed - or would be shunned - if they explored some of these topics. Of course, maybe more scholars would pay attention to some of these interesting sites if Childress would lay off the ""levitation"" and ""E.T."" musings. I don't know what to make of his travel stories. All true? Embellished? I'd like to think that there are still people out there adventuring and maybe these books will inspire others.

1190,"A synopsis of the first chapter: around 12,000 BCE, three very powerful civilizations existed in and around the Mediterranean. Atlantis was a mini-continent in the Atlantic Ocean west of the Straight of Gibraltar. The Osirian Empire was located in the basin of what is now the Mediterranean Sea and the Rama Empire existed throughout Persia and into India. The civilizations of both Atlantis and Rama possessed flying airships, very similar to those commonly reported as modern-day UFOs. In addition, the Rama Empire had some type of laser-based weapon. They used anti-gravity technology to levitate giant cut stones weighing three million pounds into position at a site in modern-day Lebanon as a landing pad for their airships.According to Jared Diamond, a preeminent cultural anthropologist, the development of agriculture did not occur until around 11,000 BCE and was localized in the Fertile Crescent until 7,500 BCE. Since one can trace food surpluses as a requirement for the settlement of cities and subsequent development of technology in cultures all over the world, it seems unlikely, at best, that the Rama Empire possessed airships, laser weapons and anti-gravity technology before humans domesticated the pea (in 8,500 BCE). It just seems a little difficult to believe that in between hunting and gathering, people had time to construct flying ships, weaponize lasers and employ anti-gravity technology. This is especially remarkable given that it took humans 14,000 years to redevelop the technology for flight and we still haven't been able to weaponize lasers or develop anti-gravity technology.The book may appeal to people looking for an interesting read, but it should not be taken as a scholarly work. In fact, the author's attempts to cite scholarly sources and research to justify his claims are laughable. Also, there are numerous typographical errors (mostly omitted prepositions and possessives as well as punctuation errors).",book
1191,"David Hatcher Childress' Lost Cities series has proven to be consistently interesting, and Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of Africa and Arabia is no exception. Taking the everyman approach to travel writing, Childress' accounts of his travels through Arabia and Egypt are very interesting and insightful, full of both interesting travel advice relevant to the regions he travelled through and accounts of personal experiences that make his stories very interesting to read. He thoroughly covers all of the major and most of the minor historical sites to be found throughout Africa and Arabia, often at great personal risk. It took guts to make the journeys he has made, many of which were in areas very dangerous for Americans, and a talent for writing to make them interesting. I thoroughly recommend this and all of the other Lost Cities series of books to all would-be travelers with an open mind and an interest in the unusual.",book
1192,"I picked up this book not realizing that I had already read excerpts from it in another of Childress' books. I was headed for Jordan and was interested in reading up on Petra when I found this book. As I read more, it began to get really interesting. His broad coverage of various theories of ancient civilizations is fascinating, if sometimes hard to believe. But, that being said, there are so many unexplained civilizations out there that, however fanciful the explanations may be, who knows, some may even be correct!! It's an entertaining read, and really causes you to reconsider some very basic historical facts that may turn out to be in error. How DID those guys at the Temple of Ba'al move 2 million pound stones?!? Makes you wonder!!",book
1193,"David Hatcher Childress makes no secret of the fact that he supports the diffusionist, as opposed to the isolationist view of prehistory (i.e. he believes there was more contact between various ancient civilisations than is generally supposed by academics). Whether one swallows DHC's views on Atlantis or the 'Osirian Empire' is really beside the point, as this book's value lies primarily in its entertaining and evocative travelogue, not in any pretensions to accuracy. Even if DHC's theories are completely bogus, his books still make entertaining reading.The reviewers who dismiss DHC's books as worthless because he isn't a scientist and engages in speculation (sample sentence: ""1932 was a good year for mysterious ancient roads in Kenya"") are themselves remarkably clown-like in their earnest simplicity. The book provides an argument against them in the form of a great quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: ""for God's sake give me a young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself!""Previous African travelogues I read include Shiva Naipaul's 'North of South' and Paul Theroux's 'Dark Star Safari', both of them sardonic, near-misanthropic works. While DHC doesn't have a literary style to match those accomplished authors, his wide-eyed optimism and childlike sense of adventure at least make an interesting contrast to the jaded cynicism of Naipaul and Theroux.As one would expect from someone who has hitchhiked through the Middle East and Africa, DHC is full of entertaining travel tales and encounters with amusing characters, like the Palestinian truck driver he gets a lift with in Jordan who makes an unexpected stop at a tent in the desert, which turns out to be a brothel, then emerges minutes later zipping his pants up, saying ""no good, no good...""In Israel he is taken to hospital with gangrene, and just as he is about to be treated, finds the place is suddenly deserted. The doctors have all gone home for the sabbath, and he has to wait another two days for treatment...One part of the book that intrigued me dealt with the mysterious Tuaregs of the Ahaggar mountains in southern Algeria. Their chief town is called Tamanrasset (i.e. Taman-Ra-Set)...a survival of ancient Egyptian paganism in a remote pocket of the Islamic world? The Arabs are said to be afraid of these mountains, and many eerie and surrealistic tales are told of them.DHC's book will appeal to those who like hitchhiking travel stories, or those who like esoteric speculation (or both). I doubt it will appeal to puritanical empiricists, but there are plenty of other books they can read instead.",book
1194,"There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure.

It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well.",book
1195,"Ok, let's get one thing out of the way. David Childress is not an archeologist. Some people seem to get hung up on this, so let's make that real clear. I always see his books in the &quot;Travel Narrative&quot; section of the bookstore, and that's exactly what they are... great travel narratives.The books has two modes. Mr. Childress' travel stories, and his telling of &quot;wacky&quot; theories of the places he visits. Within the first 25 pages, you have stories of ancient nuclear weapons, flying machines, and continent spanning civilizations that no one has heard of! And he explains that this is the &quot;easiest&quot; way of rationalizing the things he has seen! (Such as, giant blocks of stone that are too big to move, &quot;even by modern engineering&quot;).On the whole, this is a great read if you want some insight into the crazy ideas that exist out there. Childress seems to have a mainline into most of them. His travel writing is pretty good too.One note: the editing is terrible. Spelling and typos all over the place. The typography &amp; layout of the book do leave something to be desired.",book

Childress, a &quot;maverick archaeologist&quot; who seems to spend most of his time floundering around grimly impoverished Third World locales and getting nowhere with evasive women at bars, provides an insanely amusing travelogue of his journeys through the jungles and exotic landscapes of Africa and Arabia, commenting along the way on the unknown Atlantean, Lemurian, and other civilizations that flourished once upon a time and were responsible for the Pyramids, THE MAHABHARATA, and presumably Jimmy Hoffa's and D.B. Cooper's whereabouts. The most insane thing about this book is that a lot of it might be true. So far as I know, we still know very little about the Neolithic era, and the concept of &quot;lost&quot; civilizations would imaginably appeal to many readers depressed at the state of the world (including myself). However, I must agree with the other negative reviewer that Childress offers no convincing evidence to support his theories (and not very much UNconvincing evidence, either). The only sources he uses are hopelessly mossbound Victorian &quot;explorers&quot; (who knows how many African bearers' lives they may have used up to supply this book with fodder for speculation?) who had their own &quot;issues&quot; to deal with. Don't even get me started on the possible cultural-studies implications of this book. That being said, it WAS a lot of fun, and he does occasionally come up with some exciting memories and fantastical theories that NEARLY make up for my having read this book.",book

1201,"For all you TV thriller fans, The Science of Cold Case Files is an in depth exploration into the world of modern forensic science, the kind highly-acclaimed CBS TV drama `CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' is based upon. Yes, it's that interesting. It's also heavier.Like the series, there's the thrill of discovery to The Cold Case. The only other book to have given me a such a rush to date, was Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, both having in common, thriller elements and insights into a specialized world we could - who knows - accidentally careen into by force of circumstance, tomorrow. Just knowing this will engage your imagination.Except that the Cold Case delivers this with more gravity, being an expose on the dark side of man, and it's also heavy with science stuff. So, it cannot quite be described as unputdownable but the wonder of it all is Ramsland is a lucid and concise writer, so if you're a diehard CSI fan, like me, it'll be a book you'll want to finish, when you can.",book

I want it..Mr Beyerl has done tons and tons of research on this material (check out the Bibliography) and it shows. His entries are precise with magical associations, common names, and other names.. It also includes suggestions for use.Not only that but, it takes the time to explaint he various ways to use herbs.This is a wonderfull addition to any occult library..",book
1210,"There are missing pieces of material in the index; ie some of the herbal categories it lists such as ritual or magical herbs (yes there is a distinction) are left out and some herb descriptions are only a sentence or two long. While others are given several paragraphs. Honestly had I looked through this book at the book store i would have cast it under the book shelf rather than have it taking up very valuable book space in my library, the only use I expect to get out of it is the bibliography; which is sadly the case with many neopagan books. most tend to be fanciful rewrites of the originals from the 20s-late 40s when it was not considered as much herrassy to print such valuable things; and so now we all must deal with what i call; Shakespearean raven wolf syndrome where every ""tomb"" is effectivly the same and good for nothing but a door stop or kindling for my fire.not to mention the author refers to himself as a reference. not exactly what i would call good to find in a magic book.",book
1211,If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own. IT IS WORTHLESS! It is a Pagan Religion Book. Plain and simple! In my opinion it is for the study of WITCHCRAFT and the like.,book
1212,"This is without mistake, among the better herbal magic books. However, I originally bought it thinking it was on herbal alchemy rather than use for spells. It has a few too many psychological cures and not very many practical ones. You have to infer about how magical cures might turn out as medical ones. And since I mentioned alchemy, most of these are turned into incense, rather than into potions or elixirs.Otherwise, it is a very good book, especially if you're a witch in need of how to use herbs for ceremony. Ceremony is this book's specialty. It does tell many herbs used for funerals, protection, or sexual prowess.",book

Paul takes you into realms of knowledge and understanding that you do not find elsewhere. It is clear that he has been researching and working with the plants for many years. His sweetness of heart and soul come shining through in his work, and there is more information here than anyone could hope to use, not only remedially, but also magickally. This book, and all of Pauls books are a big thumbs up! Please keep it coming Paul...we await your next work with great anticipation!",book
1214,"Bright Greetings, When I first got this book I thought it was great, but upon a closer look I realized Mr. Beryl made quite a few omissions and mistakes regarding herbs and their usage. Prime example: page #250, Milkweed (Apocynum Androsaemilfolium). He suggested laying a stalk of this weed in a baby's arms at Wiccanings. If he had researched this herb in depth he would have known this is a VERY dangerous suggestion to make to the general public. (not everyone is a rocket scientist, or possesses good reasoning ability, and some might just follow his advice without precautions) This plant is a member of the TOXIC Digitalis family and could be lethal if ingested by a small one! He even went as far as to suggest using the juice of the plant as well. In my humble opinion as an old wildcrafter-buy the book, BUT..double check things if there is any suggestion of using the plant with small children or of ingesting it. (I also found errors in his nomenclature (wrong Latin name for some plants, etc.) May Your Path Be Blessed, ...",book
1215,"I found this book to be a pretty helpful resource in researching the properties of herbs for magickal purposes, though I always cross-researched with other herb books, as Beyerl's entries are not always the most comprehensive. Beyerl relies quite heavily on M. Grieve's work for his lore and history. I'll grant that Grieve's work is excellent, but I would have liked to have seen Beyerl draw from a few more sources so I didn't have to!Not a bad addition to one's bookshelf, but there may be better options out there.",book
1216,I purchased this book when I found as a source of information in the local herb store. It's not fluffy and gives a great list of source materials and recommendations for further reading materials. It's the only book I've read of this type that refers to herbs sacred to Gaia.,book
1217,"While I love this book it is not as detailed as the first. But, it is a must have for any Herbal Collection.",book
1218,"Perhaps the most promising part of this book is Beyerl's astrological correspondences of the herbs. Unfortunately, it is also the part needing the most work. For example, Beyerl tells us that the energetics of a solar herb is hot and drying, and that a lunar herb is cool and moistening. This is actually very helpful information. However, he lists ginger as a lunar herb!! The logic of this absurdity defies comprehension! Ginger is one of the hottest and most drying herbs we have! Clearly it should be a solar herb! This most obvious contradiction calls into question Beyerl's other correspondence listings.If astrological herbalism is to be taken seriously -- and there is no reason why it cannot be, assuming it accurately portrays the energetics of herbs -- it must become more rigorous, adopt accurate criteria for classification, and come up with a comprehensive and noncontradictory system that is also useful in clinical practice. Peter Holmes' book The Energetics of Western Herbs would be a useful place to begin, as he accurately describes the advantages and disadvantages of the Galenic system that astrological herbalism builds upon. Rather than attempting to interpret the planetary attributes of an herb according to its analytic effect upon isolated tissues, it would be better for astrology to develop a bodily energetics based upon the planetary archetypes. In this way, the energetics of a planet would nicely fit both physiological conditions and herbal properties, rather than trying to fit an energetic model into an anatomic model which it poorly fits. Planetary attributes of herbs must be distinguished in terms of various categories : medical/therapeutic, archetypal/active, etc. For example, certain plants have become associated with the activities of certain planets / gods which makes sense mythically, but not necessarily clinically in a medical or therapeutic sense. This does not invalidate either, but requires specific elucidation in an herbal, so we may distinguish amongst categories.We need to be fair. Beyerl has done a great deal of synthesis in his book, especially on the magical properties of herbs, which does not particularly interest me. And he cannot be blamed for the rather pathetic state of modern astrological herbalism, which is in great need of intelligent, synthetic, and clinical revival. However, without dialogue with the author -- which I would welcome, by the way -- I cannot understand his method of planetary alignment with many of these herbs.I will say that pages 434 - 453 (&quot;Working With Astrological Correspondences&quot;) is one of the strongest parts of the book, which gives us an awesome and fairly comprehensive nature of the energetics of the planets. It is only when we come to the listings that I begin to question.",book
1219,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I liked it...and I have used it, to great success. Most of what he has included is correct, well researched and well written. There are a few mistakes. I am more likely to chalk these up to poor editing than poor scholarship. But overall it is better than a great deal of what is out there.",book
1220,"Her students enter thirty-one years old music teacher Shelly Greene on Desperate and Dateless, a TV computerized matchmaking show hosting a contest that hypes the date of a lifetime. Shelly is not a fan of the opposite sex, believing facetiously that God performed a cosmic joke when she created males. She thinks even less of marriage. Thus, she wonders if the loot is worth standing at the altar on Valentine's Day marrying her DEAD SEXY cyber mate Kit Kincade just because if they make a go of it, the duo receives a ton of cash.Chaperoned by a horde of Desperate and Dateless employees, Kit and Shelly go on their honeymoon to Reunion, a former French colony tropical island paradise. As the balmy island turns nasty with everything going wrong, Shelly and Kit begin to share real feelings for one another except that nothing about him is real.Though much of the wit is HIT AND MS, chick lit fans will receive plenty of laughs especially with Shelly's one liners that make her seem at times more like a Vegas stand up comic (sorry that's Shecky Green). The story line is a lighthearted frolic that focuses on degrees of fabrication between the lead couple as a cornerstone of the relationship. Kathy Lette provides a fun romp that proves opposites attract (even when the participants are both intelligent).Harriet Klausner",book
1221,"Almost nothing can unsettle an aging baby boomer so much as the question, &quot;Don't you remember? We discussed this last night.&quot; We did? &quot;The Great Memory Book&quot; is a wonderfully expressed, beautifully put-together primer on how memory works--and sometimes doesn't, and why. Everything's here: memory types and oddities, memory strategies, and the role of lifestyle on memory. There are journal exercises and brain games (great fun to do with the person who asked the foregoing annoying question), and fascinating case studies of extraordinary memory &quot;experiences.&quot; This is an excellent interactive book; well-researched and written, informative and, in the end, ultimately reassuring to this reader, whose informed response to her questioner was, &quot;If information is not deemed meaningful, it will not be stored in long-term memory.&quot;",book
1222,"This is one of the best introductions to understanding memory today. It is comprehensive in coverage, interesting, practical and informative. You get an easy digest of current brain studies on different kinds of memory, the relevance of diet and nutrients, the influence of lifestyle, stress and pollution. Two chapters are devoted to mnemonics and there are numerous tips and strategies for improving memory. The format of the book with numerous pictures and sketches is very helpful. Once you master the foundation and the interest is aroused, people can go on to delve more deeply into related areas, such as the more recent books by Rupert Sheldrake, or the applications of NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming), esp. the submodalities, in enhancing meaning-making, learning and memory...

1235,I found the book thoughtful and enlightening. It provides a view in to the life of a family with a child at need. The book engenders a feeling of understanding and compassion for children in need. It also made me more appreciative and understanding of my children. I suggest all parents read the this though provoking book.,book
1236,"I was deeply moved by Jeff McAndrew's book, ""Our Brown Eyed Boy"" on many levels. Since my own son's diagnosis of autism recently, I began the desperate search for material to answer the numerous questions that plague a parent's mind. For me, the quest for knowledge is a healing one usually. What I find most difficult of all, however, is that this quest is often confusing or unfulfilled. That's what makes Jeff's book so unique.""Our Brown Eyed Boy"", while informational and educational, probes the autism issues from an entirely different perspective. Rather than focusing on the issue in a clinical and inhumane fashion, Jeff tackles the issues from a parent's perspective. He makes it clear time and again that feelings, not theories, are the important part of understanding autism. Through my own experience, I can relate to the fact that this is often the case. Many people, in the desire to seek a ""cure"" or coping method for autism, attempt to tackle the symptoms rather than addressing the person behind the symptoms. This theme recurs time and again throughout this personal account, and often leads to disillusionment between parents and other family members.The basis for Jeff's approach to discussing autism is honesty. The tone of this book is refreshing because Jeff brings to life that which we are often afraid to say. This models precisely the type of advocate parents must be for their children with special needs. This honesty is particularly poignant when Jeff discusses what effect their son's autism has had not only on their marriage, but on their typical son, not to mention those in the community. In one passage Jeff discusses a trip to Burger King for his sons and his wife at which another woman commented on how his wife handled the outing saying she couldn't control her children. Jeff responds by suggesting that anyone in the community should begin by stepping, even if only for a moment, in the shoes of that parent, and see if that makes a difference in their perception. As I read this portion, I, like many other parents of autistic children I'm sure, wanted to stand up and say Amen to that.Above all, however, Jeff points out that unconditional love for the child and for other members of the family is vital to maintaining a recognizable family life. The strength of this message is not in suggesting love, but in his understanding statements regarding how difficult that unconditional love can be in any family, not to mention those dealing with special needs. This is a powerful message for many parents who are often caught up in the crossfire between love, frustration, and guilt, and it is a message that, as astronaut Deke Slayton once said, needs to be said again and again with fierce conviction.",book
1237,"Jeff McAndrew tells the story of living with and loving his son Stephen, who happens to have autism. The straight-forward, open approach to a wide variety of topics should be of great help to other families dealing with this condition. I especially appreciated the addition of comments of others - parents and professionals - who also are concerned about children with disabilities. It's important to remember that interventions which are effective for one child with autism may not be at all helpful to another, and vice versa. Finding interventions that work, as well as a strong support network, can make a critical difference in a family's ability to enjoy and appreciate a special child such as Stephen.",book
1238,"The author, Jeff McAndrew, seems to imply that those families who seek outside interventions, like the GFCF diet, do so because they are not able to accept and love their child because of his/her disability. As a parent of a son with autism right around Stephen's age, I know that this implication couldn't be farther from the truth. Many parents with children with a wide range of disabilities do seek outside interventions. They love their children just as they are, but strive to have their children reach their maximum potential. It is complacency that bounds these autistic children to their own self-imposing worlds and these children need extra help to see the beauty of the world around them. It is a shame that the author is embarassed by his child's disability. My child, too, often deviates from social norms but I vowed a long time ago never to apologize to society for his disability. I love him just as he is but would like to strive for him to see the world on which he often closes the door. My son's disability has altered my own world. Sometimes it is difficult, but often it has brought me a greater appreciation for even small steps forward. Because of our ability to relate to each other, some of my greatest friends are other parents of disabled children.",book
1239,"From introduction to ending this work is one that kept me interested and coming back for more. Lundberg's writings mentally transport readers to experiences and places that quickly spring to life. The book engendered mental pictures that demanded my attention and created a storyline that melded both old and new into an experience that evoked strong memories and visions of bustling cities, ancient fortresses, and brightly colored umbrella topped tables lining village streets . I could almost feel the humidity and heat as he revealed a place and a time that has reverberated throughout history. Ulysses has never been recounted like this! And, the story with its modern approach to describing the people of Greece and the 'Greek Experience' is right on the money!",book

At the time, I thought it was torture. I didn't care to hear about the gods ever again. Now I know that reaction was one of youthful ignorance. Dr. Lundberg's book was a tantalizing invitation to revisit my thinking. I have only traveled as far as Italy, but I am now determined to get to Greece. I hope that Dr. Lundberg is in the midst of writing his next book. I want to know more about Phodas, Angela, Minos, and especially Vasso and the children. Now that I am hooked, tell me more!",book
1241,"I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star.",book
1242,"David Lundberg takes the reader on a magical and mysterious tour ... first, into ancient mythical Greece and after that, into her vibrant cities, dry arid countrysides and verdant colorful islands. The author reveals the unique and distinctive characteristics of this dynamic Mediterranean country. The reader visits tavernas, drinks a glass of retsina, nibbles on delicate honey sweetened pastries, rides the ferry boat from mainland Greece to nearby islands, soaks up the warm Mediterranean sun, marvels at the many shades of blue, azure and aquamarine colored waters of the Aegean Sea ... dips the toes into its cool clear water and even dances a zeibekiko. The reader meets lively people of all ages on this amazing tour of an ancient land and learns many fascinating historical and religious truths. Most interesting to this reader was the settlement history of the island of Cephalonia and the conversion of the Corinthians to Christianity by St. Paul. The author is well read and intersperses carefully gleaned information and insights from such authors as Edith Hamilton, who wrote ""The Greek Way"" and Nikos Kazantzakis who wrote ""Zorba the Greek"" and ""Journey to the Morea"", two of his many famous works ... The author reveals how the nation weathered many storms literally and figuratively which strengthened the spirit of the people who developed an almost fierce optimistic independence balanced with humor and faith.This superbly crafted book captures the essential nature and qualities of the Greek people and their dynamic personalities. Like the captain of a sailing vessel, the author navigates the reader through the calm and tempestuous waters of Greece's past and present through carefully chosen words and photographic word images which describe unique people and places. The reader is taken on a historical and pleasure tour of places such as Cephalonia, Lefkas, Zakynthos, Corinth, Aegina, Corfu, famous parts of Athens, and also to northern Greece, to Edessa and Kavala. After finishing this book, this reader has a desire to share the photographic impressions and wonderful discoveries learned on this magnificent argosy ... the experiences and events are unforgettable.The marvelous Greek legend about Ulysses, who goes to Troy to fight for Helen, because he pledged his word while he leaves behind his wife and child, who must fend for themselves at home, during his long absence is an allegory which many modern day Greeks live and relive one generation after the other. They have a deep longing to return home after any absence no matter what the cause for their leaving. The desire to return home was the main driving force responsible for Ulysses survival during his ardouous journey and meanderings on different islands. This book will appeal to arm-chair travellers as well as those who have literally visited many parts of the world; it makes no difference if one visited Greece or not. The book provides a distinctive and clear message about the Greek culture but most importantly about the strength, resiliency and friendly independent spirit of the Greek people. Erika Borsos (erikab93)",book
1243,"This book masterfully utilizes historic references as a framework for introducing the reader to modern day Greece and Greek culture. The life and journey of Ulysses as told in Part One is understandable and exciting! It is instructive and pleasant. Having little prior knowledge about Greek history or Greece, this tale allowed me to connect more fully to the unique islands, people, and experiences described in Part Two. After reading Olympic Wandering I am inspired to embark on my own odyssey to Greece.",book
1244,"Part One. Troy remains the only challenger to the Greek domination of the seas. However, most believe that the city-state is starting to show flab and the time to end their control of the Hellespont that links the Aegean to the Black Sea is soon. When Trojan Prince Paris allegedly abducts the beautiful Helen, Greek ruler Menelaus has his excuse to take the city. Ulysses agrees to help though he believes that Helen went willingly with her lover. Thus the lengthy Trojan War has begun *(short blip in this book). This is a terrific retelling of Ulysses' Odyssey that Homer and mythological fans would appreciate, as readers tour the islands with the great champion, on his quest, as a guide.Part Two. Author David Lundberg follows much of Ulysses'' travelogue to see how much of the spirit of the great king and his peers still live in modern day Greece. Readers will enjoy the insightful tour that could stand on its own as a fine guide to the Greek islands.OLYMPIC WANDERING is an entertaining unique look at the Greek culture that will elate readers with its use of Ulysses to tell about the glorious past and tracking his trek to relate a deep look at modern Greece. Imitation being the greatest form of flatter; this reviewer expects to see similar combos of tale and a travelogue as the pairing at least by a talented writer like Mr. Lundberg makes sense while educating and entertaining.Harriet Klausner",book
1245,"Once in a while, a book comes along that makes you *sigh*.OLYMPIC WANDERING is such a book for me. I spent 3 lovely summer months in Greece when I was too young to appreciate the gift I had been given.David Lundberg shows me the Greece I missed. And he makes me want to go back 'home' again.The Ulysses parallel didn't quite click for me, but it's been a long time since I've read the classics, so maybe the subject was just over my head and beyond my reach.When Lundberg talkes about swimming in the inky blue water, I can feel the sun and the salt and I can see the beauty of the Greek coast.Enjoy!",book
1246,"It became clear to me reading OLYMPIC WANDERING that David Lundberg loves Greece, or maybe I should call it Magna Grecia as he spends part of the book wandering over to Turkey. The best parts of the book are the sections where he describes his own experiences. The less likeable part from my perspective is the retelling of the Homeric tale. I suspect my prejudice lies in the fact that I am a woman, and as a woman, don't think the Greeks had any business attacking Troy because Helen grew tired of her husband (or was this a trumped up excuse for war?).One of my good friends and work colleagues spent many hours in Greece on a succession of trips over several years. He suggested to me that my favorite spot might turn out to be Crete should I ever make the trip. Unfortunately, Lundberg does not spend enough time with Crete, which I would have enjoyed, but rather discusses the spots visited by Ulysses and his ship mates. Another aspect of the book I would have liked to have seen enhanced would have been illustrations and possibly photos. I have a calendar with plenty of photos showing the blue sea and white stucco filled hillsides. To bad the folks who printed this small volume where not more generous with the pictures.",book
1247,"I was told to read this book by a friend and enjoyed it thoroughly. I couldn't put it down. The way it mixes in Homer's works, with his own experiences and travels is very original and works wonderfully. Being Greek I can safely say the author got us just right. He seems to love the country and the people. My only negative(ish) comment is that I wanted more, but I guess that can be said about every good book. Highly reccomended and can't wait to read his next book!",book
1248,"This book is a collection of stories and essays about Greece and the Greek character. Much of the first half of the book is a partial retelling of the Illiad in novel form, focusing on the recruitment of Achilles. The remainder of the book is comprised of short descriptions of islands or people, or anecdotes illustrating different facets of Greek culture. After the Illiad chapters, there is no continuous story line or plot; instead, the narratives are laid end-to-end, almost like a verbal photo album.Lundberg has had a long relationship with Greece, having lived and worked there for a number of years early in his career. He is also married to a Greek woman, and returns to the country often to visit relatives and friends. He clearly cares very much for the country and its people and tries to convey some of his feelings in these stories.Lundberg has a very high regard for Homer and his descriptions of Greek character, so rather than try to improve on Homer's themes, he retells some of Homer's best stories in prose, so as to be accessible to general readers. Unfortunately, Lundberg doesn't have enough room in this volume to tell Homer's stories completely, and the transitions between narrating blow-by-blow the adventures of Ulysses and commenting on the history of the stories are not always easy to follow. For those traveling to Greece, this book may provide some interesting insight to understanding the Greek national character.",book
1249,"This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!",book
1250,"Like the character Homer Thrace, in the classic 1960 movie ""Never on a Sunday,"" the American arm-chair philosopher, enamored of the ancient Athenians, and baptized in the waters of Edith Hamiltonian awe for the Grecian ideal, is, inevitably, in for a bit of a let-down when he finally visits Greece. Rather than the serene beauty and Hellenic rationality of Winckelmann or Keats, he finds Athens, a loud, dirty, overcrowded metropolis and the modern Greek, a vaguely oriental (owing to years of Turkish dominance?) and wildly exotic person of irrepressible passions, more Alcibiades than Agathon it seems. Certainly it is an exciting place and an endearing people, but, he wonders, how does it, and they, relate to the Greece he thought he knew from school-days?David Lundberg draws the connection. Tracing the travels of Ulysses --with some side excursions to the sites and sights made famous in Herodotus and Thucydides-- Lundberg takes us through modern Greece pointing out how the rugged land and never-far-away sea continue to shape the Greek character as much today at in time of Homer. We see that character, as individualistic as the thousand or more Greek isles, in the Homeric heroes, in the inventors of democracy, and in the modern Greek on the street (perhaps driving a taxi) ready to hold forth on his individual pet theories. And we see the modern Greek, like Ulysses, ever restless until he rests in his beloved and incomparable Greece.",book
1251,"While reading the book I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. In this journey, I explored the different sides of Greeks and how even today their strong sense of self emerges in their daily lives. The book creates a bridge between the past and the present revealing that Ulysses journey to come back home represents our own desire to attain fulfillment.",book
1252,"Three months ago on my trip to Europe I had the good fortune to take along Lundberg's book, OLYMPIC WANDERING. What a pleasure it was to read this travelogue of adventure! It has been quite a while since I started reading a book and did not want to put it down.The first part of the book depicts historic aspects of how (Odysseus) Ulysses tried to find Achilles, a very important warrior for the upcoming war against Troy, and his ten-year peril to return back home to Ithaca after the ten-year war.In part two of the book, it was a joy to follow Lundberg to the various Greek Islands and other parts of Greece, describing in a very personal and unique manner and with such good taste his travels during the years he resided in Greece. On occasion masterfully bringing us back to ancient times in order to bring a point across.OLYMPIC WANDERING is a must book to read!",book
1253,"This story tells of the buildup, and aftermath of the Great Trojan War, as seen the the eyes of Ulysses. Most of the first part of this short, but interesting book, tells of the search for Achilles, a famed warrior of Greece. supposing that they could not defeat Troy without him, Ulysses, and his fellow Greek warrior seek for him, to accompany them on their merry adventure.What the author lacks in detailed description of the many battle scenes(as I'm sure this was his intent-for that you will have to read Homer's Illiad, and Odyssey) he makes up for, in his description of Greece, it's people, beautiful land, and it's gods, and how they fit into today's modern Greek society.The Trojan War is handled in one short paragragh, and Ulysses' adventures on his return home, and battle to recapture his house, wife, and family from ilicit suitors is also glossed over, which is why I gave this book 4, instead of 5 stars. Even so, he directs you to books you can read in greater depth on this subject, and you still find the story interesting, and more than worth your few hours reading time.Indeed, anyone traveling to Greece for the first time, should read this book on the plane, or boat ride over, if they want to get a great taste of the land they are about to embark upon.",book
1254,"Professor Lundberg had me from the first two sentence--""The gods ordained this country for individualism. The geography demands it""--because I wanted to see how he would prove this provocative premise, and he did. His love of Greece--ancient and modern-- comes through on every page and makes one envious of his passion. Kudos, Professor.",book
1255,"A combination of travelogue, autobiography, and retelling of Greek history: The first 117 pages of the 195 give the story of Ulysses from leaving Ithaca to returning. The rest is a set of reminiscences that draw a parallel by describing journeys from the Ionian Islands to Turkey and back, culminating in Cavafy's wonderful poem about life as a journey to Ithaca.I think I understood the unifying theme but the book is rather clumsily constructed (as are the Iliad and Odyssey) and the two halves do not form an unity. There are snippets of excellent writing that bring traveling in Greece vividly to life, such as:""Satisfied with a day's work scorching the earth, the sun relaxes on the horizon. The light fades, replaced by a soft blue-gray glow. We pull into a restaurant with simple wooden tables under a canopy overlooking the water.""On the other hand some chunks of exposition of the obvious are awkwardly crammed in, such as:""Many centuries after Ulysses canals were dug across both stretches of land. Today the Corinthian canal connects its gulf to the Aegean Sea. The Suez Canal connects the Eastern Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.""The descriptions of the less well-known Ionian Islands were good. It might be of interest if you're planning a trip there. It's also worth buying if you've never read Cavafy.",book
1256,"David Lundberg skillfully blends classic Greek lit with modern culture and brings the country home to travel fans, armchair historians, and literature readers. A delightful blend of old and new, ancient and modern, historical and contemporary that everyone can enjoy, especially those studying The Iliad and The Odyssey in the classroom. Highly recommend.",book
1257,"Just as no one would try to understand the American character without learning about George Washington, it's impossible to understand the Greek character without knowing something of Ulysses.Lundberg adds a third factor, a wife who was born in Greece where he served after graduating from the US Air Force Academy. The combination serves him well; his first sentence sums up the whole meaning of Greece and the USA, ""The gods ordained this country for individualism"".Sometimes we best recognize ourselves in the portrait of another; in this book, the rampant individuality of the Greeks within a strong cultural framework presents an interesting parallel to the US. If it's read merely as a travelogue, the book is interesting for anyone planning a visit. But it is more; again and again, without tiresome comparisons being made, it is also a reflection of American attitudes.Democracy in America was built on two foundations; first, that of centuries of English individualism, and second, a study and appreciation of the basics of Greek democracy from the age of Pericles. It is much more than the spirit of 'Zorba' and 'Never on Sunday', Lundberg delves into the Greek love of personal freedom from the Trojan War to independence from Turkey.Even though he is a scholar, he writes with the calm skill and clarity of a friend rather than the precise obfuscation of a pedant. The usual travel books emphasize objects, from ancient monuments to modern taxi fares; this book offers a clear introduction to the spirit and attitude of the Greeks. It is a nice introduction to the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', as well as classics such as 'The Greek Way' by Edith Hamilton.Most books emphasize the landscape and monuments and weather and other such abstractions, with the result the depth of insight for many tourists is limited to ""saw the Acropolis, it was nice"". Read this and you'll come home with the warm feeling ""saw the Acropolis, the Greeks are wonderful people"".And, for those who don't travel, there will be an increased appreciation of America. Think of the fate of this country without 'Ulysses' -- as in Ulysses S. Grant. Lundberg doesn't offer such comparisons; but, this book is likely to unleash any reader's imagination and insight.",book
1258,"Before I start let me warn you that Greece is one of the two nations I wish to visit one day. The other nation is Japan. So I'm already kind of a lover of Greek history and culture even before I cracked open the book.Even if I had known nothing about Greece and its people Olympic Wandering would have been a delight to read. The author, David Lundberg, links the past of ancient Greece to the people of modern Greece by telling us the story of Ulysses's travels. But he uses the story to show us the culture and traditions that Greece has held and kept over the centuries. Greece has been able to keep itself together, even with invasions in the form of real armies and the more troublesome invasion of globalization, over those centuries.It is like exploring the roots of the tree. Ancient Greece, and the legends it brought us, hold the seeds of the warm, living Greece of today. Ruins might stand on the hill tops but the people keep the islands and mainland alive by just being themselves.And he can show it to us because he is now a part of it - seeing it through American eyes but with a Greek heart.I enjoyed, more than anything else, the chapters on the Greek people. Having been to Italy and Spain I can picture the warmth from the sun, the calm sea, the home cooked food and the untouched landscape.The book is not just about history nor is it some kind of tour book. It is a dialogue about the soul, the spirit, that makes up Greece and its only flaw is that one can't truly understand the Greece the author loves without one day going there.Get it new or used, but get it.",book
1259,"After reading Professor. Lundberg's book it is difficult not to agree with his love for everything Greek! The author has spent much of his adult life in Greece and has a Greek wife, so he definitely knows what he is talking about.After a brief introduction where he describes the impact Greece had on him when he first arrived Professor Lundberg tells us how deeply rooted modern Greek culture is in the ancient Greek culture of the Homeric heroes. The first part of the book is about the hero Ulysses and how he travelled *to* Troy, and in the second part of the book the author and his family follows in the footsteps of Ulysses in modern Greece. Even though a lot has changed over the millenia, the landscapes and the culture are still more or less the same. The sea, the cliffs, the friendly and curious people, the food, the wine, and the fierce individualism of the Greek people.In Greece, in contrast to the rest of the Balkans, history is not divisive, or a weapon. for the Greeks it is a uniter, somehing that makes them comfortable with their own identity. Remember that Greece has a history at least as turbulent as the rest of the Balkans with foreign occupation, war, civil war, military dictatorships, and politicians as corrupt as any! There should be a lesson for us all here.The book is not a travel guide as such, but it will help a traveller who wants to get more than just the standard tourist sights.",book
1260,"There are so many reasons to recommend this fine book that it is difficult to pare them down to a simple review. David Lundberg is a fine writer for starters: his prose is perky and eloquent at times and always atmospheric and full of momentum. Given that the technique behind this intriguing exercise is solid, on to the content.How many times do we begin to quote from mythology or reference Greek myths only to end up frustrated that all the duplicitous names between the Greek and the Roman gods get far too tangled to stay on track? The reason for this hesitancy to pick up a book about mythology is that the gods, no matter how well documented by previous historians and writers, remain aloof and defy recall: we simply can't relate to 'polytheism' we think, and thus we miss out on some truly wonderful stories.David Lundberg 'fixes' that with this delicious little book. First, he retells the major portion of the Olympians by making them real. These are no vaporous beings: these are men and women with problems and delusions and uncontrollable habits and consequences. Part One of OLYMPIC WANDERING is a major rerun of Greek mythology. Then, as if that weren't sufficient, Lundberg jumps into the present and re-walks the trails and paths of the gods in a travel book about Greece that is as useful and entertaining, enriching and atmospheric as any of the finest travel writing. Not only does he share his joy for Greece and its people and culture and food etc., but he also imparts that to us as readers like an addictive siren.Usually when reading books that are lightweight my speed of reading is rapid. Reading Lundberg was an intentionally slow process. A rapid read would have left too many morsels unnoticed along the way. This is a terrific way to re-think Greek history and culture - and to dream/plan that longed for trip to this country. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, January 06",book
1261,"This book combines the mythology/history of the Trojan War and Ulysses' attempts to return to his kingdom with the Modern Greek nation and people. The ""abduction"" of Helen is the flash point that leads to war between the Greeks and Trojans, but the geopolitical situation made the war inevitable. Troy was in a position where it could control a lucrative trade route to the Black Sea, which was damaging Greek commerce. The Greeks found it very difficult to agree on whether to go to war and who was to contribute, but in the end, they were united enough to send a fleet.As is chronicled in the Iliad, and recounted here in modern terminology, the war was a long one. Lundberg occasionally breaks in with additional material describing what the region is like now. Many Greeks died before Troy fell and those who survived were permanently scarred. Ulysses attempts to return home and his adventures, chronicled in the Odyssey, are also retold using modern terminology. Lundberg describes the regions where he traveled, making educated guesses about the location if he is not certain.The final segment of the book is about the travels of Lundberg through the modern Greek nation. He describes the people, their passions, beliefs and role in the world. It is an excellent explanation of how Greeks view life and the world.It is impossible to understate the role of ancient Greece in the rise of the Western World. While it was not democracy as we know it, the government of ancient Greece was more democratic than any seen in the Western world for centuries. Greece is also where reason and logic first became paramount in the thought processes of humans. During this time, reasoning became abstract and ideas such as the perfect circle became part of mathematical terminology. This book is a joy to read and a modern recapitulation of two of the greatest works of the literature of Western Civilization.",book
1262,"David Lundberg has written a remarkable book. OLMPIC WANDERING is a unique work. It first tells the story of Ulysses, a story we all know from our study of Western Civilization. Then, Dr. Lundberg takes his book on the freshest of twists. He traces the journey Ulysses took, except he traces it in our time. As he travels with us around the spectacular land of Greece, the reader is treated to an amazing experience through the eyes of an accomplished gentleman author. The reader sees Greece as it has never before been revealed. While I have not traveled to that region of the world since the millennium flipped, I thoroughly enjoyed David Lundberg's travel memior/historical novel. It is a fanstatic book that I recommend highly for every reader.",book
1263,"For me merely the word `Greece' elicits a fusion of magic with the mystical. An ancient land where gods walked, a country that delicately balances the sensibilities of the east with the west, a topography of stark physical beauty and breathtaking seascapes ---- Greece invades your soul even for those of us who have not personally journeyed there. The sights and sounds of even a before-Christ Greece echo with familiarity in our minds; we see enlightened men and women in snowy chitons and himations debating politics and proving the existence of the gods in effortless eloquence as they craft the bright citadel of Western Civilization without the boost of technology or advise from either the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Perhaps not by grand design, the descendants of these quintessential `Westerners' have carried in their DNA that special synergy of individualism and collectivism that deems their society an experiment that still succeeds today.In his book, ""Olympic Wandering: Time Travel through Greece"", David Lundberg explores just this notion, combining his personal enthusiasm for Hellas as expressed through his admiration for his Greek wife and her family with cultural accolades that he can trace back and be attributed to the people of the pre-historic time of Homer.Part one of this slim volume utilizes character-identifying snippets from the Iliad and the Odyssey where Lundberg's retelling of the stories in his own simple and easy-to-follow language, establishes just why Homer's great king of Ithaca, Odysseus (or Ulysses), epitomizes the ultimate human hero for both the Greeks and all of Western Civilization. For Lundberg, Ulysses becomes the archetypal every-Greek male. As the fundamental father, husband, leader, strategist and athlete, he commands the respect and loyalty of the lives he touches, personifying the human spirit at its best---a spirit that Lundberg contends typifies Hellas and its people now in modern times.With little effort, Lundberg unearths this indomitable spirit as Part Two of the book tracks the footsteps of Ulysses, commencing with Ithaca, traversing the Peloponnesus to Troy, meandering through the wine-dark Aegean and wind-blown Mediterranean until finally returning to the legendary home front of the Ionian islands. While escorting the reader on a modern tour of the Greek mainland and its islands, Lundberg comments on issues and sensibilities that face and affect all of us in the modern world, With each venue change the supercritical survival mechanism inherent in the racial makeup of his adopted people becomes more and more apparent as Lundberg discusses their views on globalization, health, drinking, self-identity, Diaspora, hospitality, age-old rivalries, family connections, and unsuppressed emotion. Lundberg enables the reader to see the multi-faceted nature of the Greeks through a filter of clearly and beautifully described Attic light.Not so clear, however is Lundberg's desire to state the theme of each step of his journey in a more concise format. By interjecting numerous anecdotes and sidebars-an unedited by-product of his own infectious fervor for the subject, &#9472; he sometimes confuses rather than infuses his overall idea for each chapter with too many ideas that leaves the reader with less rather than more. Instead of dividing the book into two parts, I would have liked to have read a retelling of each episode of Ulysses' life complete with Lundberg's original dialogue and then, as introduced by a font change, enjoyed his exuberant comparisons and sincere conclusions as exemplified by his present-day observations and delighted participation in this way of life.Bottom line: The author of Olympic Wanderings is privileged in formulating first-hand the delicate and respectful equation of the Greek mindset, weighted heavily with variables of awareness, survival and joie de vivre. Despite some murkiness in theme and format, Davis Lundberg nevertheless undoubtedly and unabashedly displays his love of the Greeks. And so I recommend this book to all who have felt Hellas in their souls and for any who want to interject a little Homer into their quest for archetypal identity.",book
1264,"A beautifully written, easy to read, informative book about a unique country. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy every page, I received an education as Dr. Lundberg explores the Greek islands, the gods from the past including the journey of Ulysses, and acquaints us with the people as he time travels from past to present.I want to thank Dr. Lundberg for recommending his book to me via Amazon friends. This is one country I have not visited during my armchair travels with good books and fortunately I obtained it, read it with pleasure, will share it, and highly recommend it to readers who want to enjoy a ""different"" type of travelogue of adventure.The portrayal of Greece with its deep blue skies, numerous islands, independent, hospitable and attractive people, and rich history is a masterpiece. I only wish it were a few hundred pages longer!",book
1265,"I must admit that David Lundberg is very descriptive in his words whether describing a simplified story of the Battle of Troy or Greek Culture today. I enjoy the passion he exhibits in describing family and friends who he has encountered while visiting this intriguing of the world. Some of the events in his modified story of Ulysess are quite noteworthy particularly finding Achillies dressed in womens garb.However the connection between parts one and two is a little vague and somewhat off the mark. Lundberg describes the greeks as passionate and emotional yet Ulysess's safe journey home was due to the fact that he keep his emotions in check. According to text earlier in this book, Ulysess was guided to be this way from his father. Lundenberg also gives many anecdotes of many characters who he met whie touring the Greek Islnds. Some he describes more vividly than others. But nowhere does he describe a modern day person in comparison to someone from the days of Ulysess and Hellen of Troy.Those who have a greater appreciation for Greek Culture might have more insight into what Lundberg is trying to say. I would certainly recommend such an audience to peruse this book and the journey may certainly take you someplace special. I certainly could appreciate some parts myself.",book
1266,"Olympic Wanderings is an excellent travel book. David Lundberg describes in such detail the geography, history, food, and people of Greece in just under 200 pages. I truly felt that I was travelling through the islands of Greece while reading this book. I pictured myself drinking some Greek wine called restina on the coast of Cape Sounion and eating some sweet pastries at a paticcera or sweetshop on the island of Cephalonia. I imagined looking at the beautiful Zante style arches of the buildings on the island of Zakynthos.The first part of Olympic Wanderings is about the life and travels of King Ulysses of Ithaca. Lundberg explains how Ulysses was recruited to fight in the war against the Trojans by King Agamemnon and Menelaus. His wife Helen was captured by the Trojan prince Paris. This is the central conflict of the Trojan War, and I think Lundberg explains this very easily in a way I wish my teachers did.Dr Lundberg spends half his time living in North Carolina and half his time living in Greece, because his wife is Greek and her family still lives there. I think Lundberg makes very interesting observations between the modern people of Greece and the ancient King Ulysses from the island of Ithaca.King Ulysses was a persuasive speaker who was equally comfortable sailing a ship as with working on a farm. He was a true renaissance man capable of doing many things. Modern Greek people are a balanced nation of people who can adapt and work in many different environments. Another interesting parallel between Ulysses and modern Greek people is the idea of having a love of their home. Home is not a singular central location with four walls to a Greek person. The idea of home to a Greek person includes the entire environment around them like the mountains and seas. Another parallel between ancient and modern Greek times is the social climate. The city states in Greece today have an inability to unite and live harmoniously. In a similar fashion, the Greeks and the Trojans fought in ancient times long ago. I also learned that most of the Greek islands were once occupied by Turkey and that the country was torn between the Moslems on the East and the Christians on the West. I hope to travel to Greece someday to experience the beauty of the islands and the fun loving intelligent people David Lundberg discusses in Olympic Wanderings. This is a very entertaining and informative book.",book
1267,"If you are even remotely interested in the fascinating culture of the Maya than this book will more than peak your interest. It is not a significant historical document, but rather features some of the most intriguing drawings from the mysterious culture. The drawings themselves are masterful black and white details of Maya life. The drawings are a young educators dream, the pictures would make good reproductions for distribution for students to use. For students, the possibilities are endless, but one thing that can be done is use them for a mural or enlarged drawings. While teaching, I used these drawings for that purpose and students created giant posters that they worked on in groups in their FREE time during lunch and later were displayed for festive occasions celebrating cultural heritage. Anyway, the drawings are really nice and bold and full of ideal designs for graphic artists, craftspeople or any type of visual artist to translate into a new work of art. The exotic pictures are not without some written word as the author gives a brief overview of the culture. The book begins with an excerpt from the Mayan book &quot;The Popul-Vuh. &quot; Each page is numbered in English and Mayan for an addional bonus for students. An explanation is given regarding the number system and the complex calendar as well as the omens associated with each day. Many of the drawings come from details in the huge stellae, thoses monuments to a forgotten time found in the remote jungles of places like Tikal and throughout the Yucatan and Honduras. The drawing are rich in detail and some require extensive looking at to &quot;find&quot; all the elements of exotic intrigue. Bits and pieces can be used to create your own design or for an inspiration for something new.

1287,"The best fantasy writers not only invite us to explore the magical, but guide us along the way with credible, world-building skills and sympathetic, recognizable characters that engage our imagination, but never tax our belief. Such is the case with Barbara Campbell's HEARTWOOD.I read this book over the course of a weekend in spring but for all I knew, I was not sitting in my backyard with the drone of cars and leaf-blowers and other modern ""conveniences"" competing for my attention. Instead, I was transported to the land of the Oak-Lord and the Holly-Lord where a Midwinter battle determined the advent of spring or the curse of a world locked in the frozen grip of winter.And it is ""heart"" that is the key word in this novel. While the fantastic descriptions will delight and frighten, the characters, from the troubled hero, Darak, to the wise, but aging Tree-Father,Struath, to the sadistic villain Morgath --all-- are ""known"" to us on some level. And that, in my opinion, is this author's greatest gift. Even the god Trickster, cunning, conceited and unpredictable as he is, reminds us of the times we wonder if our Maker doesn't have an unusual sense of humor.If you want to experience a seemingly lost world where the changing seasons are greeted with hope, awe and wonder versus large appliance sales, read HEARTWOOD.

The balance of nature is off and a brave band of folk go off into the endless winter to see if they can set it right. On their journey they meet gods who walk the earth: a delightful Trickster, whose charm and sense of humor can almost make you forget the mischief he makes; a villain who can shape-shift by taking over the bodies of any living creature; a spirit-guide who offers assistance to the aging shaman.

1292,"I live in the Indianapolis area, so this book is extra special. The photographs are amazing. It tells the story of the old Indianapolis and how life used to be in our fair city. The canal is lovely to look at now, but the author takes us back to when the canal was used for trade. You can still shop at LS Ayres in the suburbs, but you can't shop in the store downtown in all it's history and glory. shopping used to be a big event. This book is wonderful. The stories are told in a way to take you back in time. Who knew Indianapolis had interurbans &amp; streetcars? Now I Know....",book

1294,"I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called &quot;Lost Indiana&quot; which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it.",book
1295,"""Lost Indianapolis"" is part of the very large ""Images of America"" series of books that feature historical photos of landmarks of a city or group of people and tell part of the history as well. From time to time ""then and now"" photos are included as well so that the reader can see how things have changed.""Lost Indianapolis"" is a great book for those with an interest in Indianapolis for two reasons:1) The photographs. They are interesting and very well-chosen to add to the text. I have seen books of this sort that seem to have random pictures tossed in with the text.2) The text. McDonald has chosen several interesting topics to tell some of the story of the city. This is not a complete history by any means, but he does a thorough job of telling episodes in the city's history.Topics covered in the book include: the central canal, Union Station, the Interurban system, the Stutz company, Carl Fisher, Riverside Park, Burger Chef and Market Square Arena.The Interurban system was an electrical train system that ran from Indianapolis and connected with similar systems all over Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. McDonald tells the story in both a thorough and interesting way, including how the electrical plants required to power the trains eventually started to sell their extra energy to nearby customers and morphed into two modern-day utility companies still operating in the state.The history of the Stutz Company is interesting because it begins to tell the story of Indianapolis and its love affair with the automobile. The Stutz Bearcat was the most famous car to come out of the factories that still stand on Capitol Avenue (they now house offices and a series of art studios).McDonald also tells the story of Carl Fisher, an automotive pioneer in many ways - he had one of the first car dealerships in the world, he sold parts, including the first working headlights and the electric starter. Most importantly, he was part of the team that created the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and began the tradition of the Indianapolis 500 in 1911. He includes a great action photo of Fisher testing out the track before it was paved with more than 3 million bricks in 1911.I very much enjoyed the section on Burger Chef as well. I did not realize that one of the warehouses I drive by from time to time on West 16th street was actually the corporate headquarters of Burger Chef! I have fond childhood memories of the Fun Meal at Burger Chef featuring the characters Burger Chef & Jeff - the forerunner to the McDonald's Happy Meal. Lost Indianapolis details the growth of company and the men who founded it. Interestingly, they had made several fast food kitchen devices to make things like soft-serve ice cream, shakes and flame-broiled hamburgers and started the first Burger Chef as a showcase restaurant to demonstrate their products. It was so successful they decided to franchise their system.""Lost Indianapolis"" is marred by several typographical errors, but the good information and interesting stories more than made up for that.",book
1296,"Thanks to all who have made this book one of the best selling titles on Indianapolis. I had a great time writing it, and am working on a couple of follow-on projects, including one specifically about Burger Chef - so send me mail at webmaster@lostindiana.net if you have stories about Burger Chef to share.About the editing - there is a major typographical error in the book, in that &quot;Ayres&quot; is spelled incorrectly several times. There are also a couple of other editing errors.What happened? Very simply the final edited version was not the one printed! Though a mixup with the publisher, one of the pre-edited versions was actually printed.The good news: the next printing of the book has the errors corrected. This is especially good news for those who buy the book now, because you'll have the &quot;first edition&quot;, a real collector's item. :)I hope you enjoy it as much as I did writing it.",book
1297,"Lost Indianapolis contains a history of eleven aspects of the city. Loaded with photos mostly from the Indiana Historical Society, it really brings home the feel of life in Indianapolis way back when. Unfortunately, as one other reviewer noticed, the book is chock full of grammatical and typographical errors, which make it somewhat painful to read. Hoosiers are already known for having an exceptionally poor education system, and this book will not lead anyone to believe differently. Definitely worth reading, but not worth the price, as it leaves much of the city's history unexplored and unaccounted for.",book
1298,"I truly enjoyed the concept of this book. I agree with the previous reviewer that the photographs are exceptional in that they often depict the history of a subject as well as the present.I am quite disappointed, however, in the editing (or lack thereof) of the book. It appears that the manuscript was put together in haste. The editor and/or the publisher really fell short of their job.Because I was born, and still live in Indianapolis - and my family history began in this city around 1850 - I looked forward to reading each of the chapters. Unfortunately, the frequent grammatical and typographical errors really distracted from the content. If the work had been edited, it would have a home among other treasures on my bookshelf. It is sad, however, that I would be expected to pay even Amazon's discounted price for a piece that could have truly been a treasure - if someone had just taken the time to edit it.",book
1299,"Charles Segal's book entitled ""Conversations with Lincoln"" offers a unique view into both our country's early history as well as the personal and political struggles that Abraham Lincoln endured throughout his tenure as our nation's leader. While many authors have explored various aspects of Lincoln and his administration, Segal's innovative approach provides an objective assessment of the political and social dynamics that surrounded Lincoln's decision-making throughout his presidency. By chronologically organizing excerpts from personal interviews and narrative accounts, ""Conversations with Lincoln"" captures Lincoln's valiant effort of uniting the United States while steadfastly working to protect the integrity of the Constitution. Lincoln's own thoughts provide rare social commentary as well as vivid insight into one of America's greatest leaders. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a more accurate perspective of both Abraham Lincoln and the United States during this extraordinary time period.",book
1300,"This book collects together Paine's Common Sense (which was instrumental in collecting and gathering America's attention to the benefits of strict independence from Great Britain); his letters or series entitled &quot;the American Crisis,&quot; which galvanizes his previous topics; gives a brief account of his engineering work for arches bridges; provides another span of letters on his involvement in the French Revolution, and finishes with his Age of Reason, in which he examines and debunks the Bible. Though his reasoning and conclusions may alarm some and even offend others, his thinking and writing is lucid and cogent, and for reflective minds will provide much food for thought. Accused of sophistry and impudence by some of his contemporaries, his reasoning is normally sound and simple, as he inquires into the root of things, and only seldom does he make debating points fit only for the playground. A sensible and likable man, Paine's writing should engage any American for its historical sense, any lover or researcher interested in human rights and the hope of removing human misery, and any person interested in reading the entertaining but vital arguments of a man whose love of liberty and order forced him late in life to become one of America's most influential revolutionary and socially-minded voices.",book
1301,"A &quot;must have&quot; for any legitimate personal &quot;library&quot;.Paine's thoughts are important reading for every person who would call himself educated and versed in the history of ideas about how society should organize -- particularly &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. I myself would have included him in Stephen Covey's &quot;Wisdom Literature&quot; (&quot;First Things First&quot;). Carl Sagan cites him (&quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot;) in support of his own reflections on &quot;the God hypothesis&quot;.COMMON SENSE speaks to form and purpose of government and was the pivotal Revolutionary pamphlet in which Paine disected and debunked the legitimacy of monarchy, giving voice to the growing feelings in the Colonies that being ruled by the King of England had become obsolete. Paine's articulation served to &quot;tune&quot; the chorused voices of the Colonies, which before his writing, were loud but out of tune. (War was underway, but the Colonies not well organized in a joint defense.) COMMON SENSE even has a refreshed relevance in the aftermath of the 9/11/01 tragedies in New York, as we re-examine some of our institutions.THE AGE OF REASON will be disagreeable reading to devout followers of any organized religion -- particularly Christians -- as it is Paine's book-by-book disection and denunciation of the Bible (and, by extension, the &quot;scriptures&quot; of all other religions) as a collection of fables, nurtured through the ages for corrupt purposes of church leaders (starting hundreds of years BC). But, almost by definition, an educated person MUST acknowledge disagreeable ideas and THEN make disposition of them Once in a while &quot;disagreement&quot; is even persuaded to new thinking, n'est ce pas?.This edition is a particularly excellent resource for these pieces and Paine's other writings. It is scrupulously based on the best discoverable versions, with meticulous notes documenting the sources.The physical quality of the printing and binding is premium in every aspect, and will last for generations. Truly a &quot;library&quot; quality volume, far superior to the typical &quot;best seller&quot; construction.",book
1302,"Thomas Paine's greatness lied in his ability to take the abstract ideas of the American Revolution and make them graspable by all of his time, while infusing them with the moral passion that they truly deserved. Paine is one of the great masters of ideas taken into action.His immortal opening of the ""American Crisis"" was like new fuel to a dying flame. ""These are the times that try men's souls,"" he wrote, and his arguments for continuing the revolution reminded the patriots of the meaning of their fight. And Paine could not have been timelier-his words came at a time when the success of the revolution seemed much in doubt.Perhaps more than any man, he breathed new life into the patriots though his keen analysis and moral passion. 225 years later, he still gives life to the idea of America, even as our freedoms come under increased threat.Thomas Paine is required reading for any student of America who wishes to understand the ideas from which America was made real.",book
1303,"Thomas Paine was the most consistent and important of all the American Founding Fathers. He consistently spoke up in favor of liberty and freedom; for example, his opposition to the institution of slavery (which he argued was immoral and un-Christian and thought it quite contradictory to claim to be a Christian on the one hand and support slavery on the other hand) - Paine also spoke up in support of women's rights, freedom of thought, the poor, etc.The important thing about Paine is that he practiced what he preached, as opposed to just about every other founding father (e.g., Jefferson saying all are ""created equal"" but owning slaves, or Adams ""dismissing"" his wife's assertion that they too should be included in the political process). I don't think we ought to condemn those individuals for the beliefs that they had, indeed they were products of their time period - and they are worthy of study. However, I also believe that we should praise those who were able to step out of that period and see things as they are, this is what Paine was able to do.If you doubt Paine's importance in the history of American independence, consider the following; probably no other phamphlet brought the idea of independence to the mind of the colonists like Paine's ""Common Sense"" did and it was Paine's ""Crisis #1"" that was read to Washington's soldiers before they prepared for the biggest fight of the American Revolution. Paine's defense of the French Revolution in his ""Rights of Man"" sparked off a publication war that has yet to be matched and his ""The Age of Reason"" delineated the philosophical ideas that most of the founding fathers had with regard to religion (regardless of what the religious right would have you to believe).Paine's mistake was not believing what most of the founding fathers believed, that the ""common man and woman"" was not intellectual enough to handle the arguments that he (and the others) were advocating. It was his consistency which brought about his downfall - this is a shame, because he is one of the most important thinkers to come out of the Revolutionary Period in American history.",book
1304,"When I started reading Common Sense I had a hard time because the text was so dense, but when I decided to read it aloud, the text came to life--it was like discovering Shakespeare. Actually, the second set of texts is a collection of about ten essays called ""The American Crisis"" (numbered 1-10), and I thought these were even better. In them Paine tries to convince the American public that Great Britain doesn't have a chance against the 13 Colonies. Sort of like the Iraqi Information Minister telling his people that the Iraqi's will ""roast the American soldier's stomaches in hell"", while American shells explode in the background, shaking the building he's speaking from. The oratory of other greats such as Jim Carvill and Muhammad Ali came to mind, too, but the text is so well written, as to approach Shakespeare.""These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.""It's almost comical, in retrospect, because he address a few essays directly to the British General in charge, Sir William Howe. To the most powerful general in the world he says, ""England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of a cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier, and by the sample we have taken prisoners we begin to give the preference to ourselves.""He does make good points, but the abuse, both exaggerated and level-headed, just goes on and on. It was truly a pleasure to read. And even though the pages turned slowly, it just felt good to savor his words.The book is about 800+ pages, so reading the whole collection like a novel is just too much work for most. The varied texts (about 35 in total) are arranged chronollgically, which is nice. Besides Paine's major works, Common Sense, The Crisis, the Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, there is also a nice smattering of smaller essays.Additionally, there are very helpful footnotes in the back of the collection, but there are no numbers within the text; the notes are listed by page and line number.The essays were written about very topical subjects, so it is most helpful to have done a fair amount of general reading before attempting to tackle Paine so you know what he is talking about, though the notes do help. There is also a very nice chronolgy of Paine's life in the back, as well.It was an absolute pleasure reading these primary source texts. I understand now why Common Sense sold 120,000 copies within months of being published and what an essential role Thomas Paine played in keeping up the spirits of the colonists during the very discouraging early years of the War of Independence.A previous reviewer commented on how the high-quality, super-thin pages made the text small, light-weight, and easy to read. I'd have to agree.",book
1305,"Thomas Paine was an Englishman whose writings had a profound effect on the American Revolution and in the debate in the English speaking world on the French Revolution. This wonderful volume from the Library of America provides his major writings in one volume. Knowing these works is important to your understanding of what ideas were in circulation at the time of our founding and what was being debated on both sides of the Atlantic.""Common Sense"" takes on the idea of monarchy and of American Independence with arguments that amount to no more than common sense. Paine takes apart the idea that monarchy comes from God using the logic of the current English constitution and its internal checks wondering why a form that comes from God would need such a check. As for American Independence, he points out that a small island might need protection from a greater power, but why would a continent need protection from a small island. He also points out that our previous dependence on Britain is not reason to continue the relationship. Children begin as helpless babes, but do not drink milk forever. The time inevitably comes when the child must take its place in the world as an independent adult. There is much more to his arguments, but this gives you a sense of how he argues. This tract was printed many times and made a huge noise in the world.""The Crisis"" or ""The American Crisis"" is a series that reports on aspects of the War for Independence that began in December of 1776 when things were not going all that well for the Americans. The first in this series begins with the famous sentence, ""These are the times that try men's souls."" And goes on about the summer and winter soldier.""The Rights of Man"" is Paine's argument for the French Revolution and specifically taking on the arguments of Edmund Burke against what was going on in France after their Revolution. In my view, Paine is pretty much off the rails here, especially when he lists the rights declared by the French. For example, compare number three of these declarations with the American notion that man is sovereign whose rights are given him by God. The French say, ""The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it."" Oy. Anybody see tyranny justified in that one?In ""The Age of Reason"" Paine takes on sectarian religion and all orthodox Christianity, which Paine does not like. He advocates a Deism as superior to all religions. Sigh.Anyway, these are important essays and had a big impact in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and are a part of our history. Students of our history need to know these works.This fine edition also has notes on the text and a chronology of Paine's life.",book
1306,"A fantastic compilation of one of our nation's most influential authors. Paine was a tremendous voice in the colonial period and without a doubt inspired many with his earlier writings. The Age of Reason, while a great work, is a dsiplay of how Paine was intolerably harsh of people's religious beliefs.",book
1307,"This was purchased to 1)assist my child in school; it was helpful, and 2) to add to history book collection.",book
1308,"On the one hand, I loved the book, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. However, my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of ""The Age of Reason"". When they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books, they should remove this review. At that point, I will eagerly buy a new copy.",book
1309,"I just finnished reading a Common Sense and I thought it was extremely radically written by a very perswasive or better said agressive aproach.However there are passing a very big amount of very very interesting arguments which are surely ones to reminded forever.As a historical person I dont think I have to add something to his personality already, since its a very difficult one to avoid. And in fact he should be remembered for what he did. Only to bad that a great man had to end in such a way.The stuff thats gathered in this book is amazing. It contains his 4 somewhat major works. But also several shorter one, a few letters and other writings. I think for every historystudent of that age, looking for some thoughts in the pure sense of the enlightenment. Thomas Paine is your man.",book
1310,"Some of Paine's arguments state that he can't accept the revelations of others because he cannot be assured of THEIR credibility. This comes from a man that failed out of school at 12 years old, failed at every job he attempted, and is only remembered for his statements in support of the American Revolution, which he only was apart of for a few years before it took place.Much of Paine's arguments contain fallacies. His belief of an Age of Reason is not supported by logical or reasoning abilities. One example is the logical fallacy Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (after this therefore because of this). One of Paine's arguments is that Satan was punished by being sent to a pit; Paine then states that the Greek god Jupiter punished his opponent (giants) by confining one under a mountain (Paine claims resulted in volcanoes). Paine claims that BECAUSE the legend of Jupiter imprisoning his rival allegedly preceded the concept of Satan being imprisoned that the Christian belief in Satan must have been derived out of the Jupiter legend. Paine's assumption excludes the fact that earthy crimes committed throughout all ages have had punishment or prison associated with them, and the claim that the Jews would have had to study Greek mythology to create their own beliefs is a complete hypothesis on Paine's part.Paine's statements are wishy-washy to say the least. He makes statements that the Bible is only hearsay and has no merit, and then at other times makes statements based on Biblical passages as though they were a matter of fact. He states that Jesus was a great teacher, and that he (Paine) is going to stick with the philosophy of Thomas (doubting Thomas) and demand to see proof of everything. If Paine's theories were true that the Bible was only hearsay, he would have no way of judging what Jesus taught as his (Paine's) beliefs do not allow for Jesus or Thomas to have even existed.A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.In LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE it says: ""Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible teach the same doctrine? It does not.""This concept of God being a God of Justice and Truth is taken from the Revelations of the Bible and not from the Deist's use of Reason. By simply observing Creation to understand God as Deist claims you would not come to the understanding of God as a God of Justice and Truth. The world is not naturally just. If you base your religion on observing nature you are more likely to conclude that God is growing people in order to eat them, as that is what is observable in nature. Human's raise animals for food and are not concerned about providing the animals with truth and justice. These traits cannot be determined by observing the movements of the sun or the actions of man.Observing the nature of man; to rob, rape, and kill would appear to be a natural state of man, as these actions have been recorded throughout all history and still exist today. If Deists hold to the belief of judging God by observing the creation without giving any thought to Biblical Revelation then there is not cause to label such actions as sin. Revealed religion is what labels these instincts as sin. Paine's view originates in his Quaker up bringing, which he then perverts and intermixes with his concept of Reason to make up his odd belief and questionable belief system.Paine also rests some of his arguments on the new definition that he gives to the word Revelation. He redefines the word to meet his desires. The problem with this argument is that when debating the usage of a word relating to a topic thousands of years earlier it is necessary to use the definition of word at that time. By changing the definition of the word thousands of years later you do not invalidate how it has been used for centuries. This argument is also a logical fallacy called the Straw man in which Paine creates his own new definition of the word and argues against his own definition and not the actual topic.Much of Paine's view on Reason comes from ethnocentric thinking that He (educated to the level of a 12 year old boy) has a superior ability to think than those who have lived in the past. Paine views himself as an enlightened thinker when in fact the opposite is true. He values the usage of Reason in gaining wisdom, but the Reason that Deism promotes is ignorance. It involves a lack of study or research, and is simply the concept of ""Believe whatever you reason without considering anything other than your own opinions"", and leaves man to his own devices. The problem is that the Bible documents the results of man being left to his own devices, and if REASON were really being applied then an enlightened thinker would STUDY and learn from the mistakes of those of the past to prevent themselves from falling into the same snares.There is nothing enlightened about reasoning through ignorance. Much of Paine's problems with Christianity are not actually with the Word of God (as Paine claims they are), but are against man's hypocrisy and use of religion wrongfully. The Bible is also against these things, so Paine's attacks on the Bible are misdirected. Paine's argument that Christianity is wrong simple because other religions exist is foolish. One would not assume that all foods are poisonous simply because some of them are. If you do not want to eat poisonous food the answer does not lie in blindly making up your own recipes and biting into them hoping you wouldn't die, but lies in studying the good and bad recipes to determine where the poison is in order to use the correct recipe that will allow you to live; that is how REASON is to be used intelligently. If you are an enlightened thinker then you would analyze, evaluate, contemplate, understand, and reason to determine the truth. Making up your own philosophy based on what feels good to you is not enlightenment, and it is not even a new way of thinking; this error is commonly documented in the Bible.Paine's arguments show only a superficial understanding of the Bible. If he were to put effort into studying the Bible and applying reason to it then his questions and objections to it would be answered. He would also be able to answer why some religions are false ones and why they are so. As it is Paine argues that all religion say they are right and since they all cannot be right Paine assumes that none of them can be right. This is another error in his reasoning. Certainly there are an infinite number of examples of people doing things wrong, but someone else being capable of doing it right.",book
1311,This book is a great read. The letters he wrote were worth the price of the book. I recommend it.,book

1314,being a student of history for as long as i have my history library would not be complete without the works of mr. paine. he definitely knew how to write a good write and no history library is good without paines writings.,book
1315,"I love this series of books, and seeing what was actually written by the actual Founders that people mention helps to cut through the bogus to get to the Truth.For example, owning the Thomas Jefferson edition of this series, and upon reviewing his letter to the Baptists, it is clear that Jefferson- even in the letter that Progressives like to reference- never once advocates the separation of Church and State for the entire Nation. And when you understand the specifics involved in the Baptist situation, it becomes terribly obvious that the agenda to discredit the Judeo- Christian founding of the United States has been afoot for some time.Likewise, with Thomas Paine you get several of his works in 1 volume. Beautifully bound book, I particularly like the older, slip-case versions. Here are some of the most impactful and well-known writings of Paine, and if you are looking to build your Founders library like I am, you could do alot worse than getting this book.I'm not sure how many other Greats are in this series, but I'm looking next at finding Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln.If you are fan of Liberty, and love the founding of this Great Nation, then you can't go wrong owning the writings of the actual men that created it.",book

1321,"Paine's writing is rich with stunning clarity. He was one of America's most brilliant and inspiring writers. That is if you don't read any of 'RICKYTHEREADER's reviews. RICKYTHEREADER has reviewed exactly four books on the amazon website, all about Paine and all delving into proselytizing (over 50 mentions of the bible or Jesus between the four reviews). Further, he's obsessed with the fact that Paine failed out of school at the age of 12. Does this mean we must discount his body of work? Einstein was a slow learner, perhaps that 'lightbulb' idea wasn't quite as good as we all thought. Hey, think what you want, but disliking someone's views has little to do with the quality of their work. Especially of someone as deservingly revered as Paine. If he's such a mediocre writer, why did RICKYTHEREADER dig into FOUR of his books? I love Paine, but I've not read that many! My message to RICKYTHEREADER: Love God if you wish, but don't write reviews with an agenda. Write a review of the work.",book
1322,"Thomas Paine, especially in The Age of Reason, did not put forth completely original ideas. Many of his contemporaries had the same critisms that Paine did in regard to organized religion especially Christianity. However, Thomas Paine organized such thoughts in a way that they were accessible to common men. Unfortunately his brave and inspirational work was his downfall. Closeminded and fearful citizens, like RICKITHEREADER in our modern times were frightened that perhaps Paine was tearing a hole the the fabric of their blind faith and because of this, Paines' last work, The Age of Reason, left him to die alone and impoverished. He was abandoned, even by his intellectual contemporaries, most who agreed with him but were not brave enough to voice their beliefs in the common vernacular. I was inspired by Paine who wrote, ""My mind is my own church,"" which was not the voice of an atheist but the voice of a man who really did know the ""truth"" and his true path. Unlike RickitheReader, I have read both the bible and Paine with an open mind and heart. The joy of reading is the ability to let it lead you to new places. Thomas Paine would have said it better. Read this compilation and it will lead you to new places, wherever your faith is.",book
1323,"On the plus side, the work is extremely thorough and a very aesthetically pleasing printing. It's 900 pages, yet the book is nicely compact.I don't base my rating so much on the content itself; after all, it's difficult to argue too much with the importance of Thomas Paine, whether you agree with the tenor of his ideas or not. Plus, how do you rate, say, a personal letter?I give this a tepid review because I find the editing lacking. Despite the big name, the book is, essentially, a collection of his writings, with little else. ""Great"" you may say; I simply note, don't be swayed by having Eric Foner's name attached to this. For the most part, you will be on your own to determine the context of the individual pieces. For a professional historian, that may be fine, but for an amateur like myself, it became frustrating. Foner has included a section ""Note on the Texts"" and a section ""Notes."" But all the first section really gives is the publication date and where the item first appeared; the notes themselves are quite sparse and aren't footnoted in the text (hence, you have no idea while you read the text whether there's a note or not). To give an example of the problem with context, a sample selection: ""Response to 'Observation on the American Revolution.'"" The entry begins, ""Mr Dunlap..."" If you turn back to the ""Notes on the Text,"" Foner's only context for this 6-page letter is when and where it was first published. Not helpful. One can read between the lines that it's a response to something (""Observation..."") that was published somewhere, by someone (""Mr Dunlap?""). But Foner doesn't tell us what that was. Nor does he even explain who it's too. Maybe historians can readily look at the date and see Mr. Dunlap and know who off the top of their head who ""Mr Dunlap"" is. I can't. This is one example out of about 50. Virtually every non-obvious/major work in the book, I had to turn to Wikipedia to try to figure out who he's writing or responding to.That being said, I appreciated the chronological organization of it - it's interesting to see the man progress over time... or regress, depending on your point of view.",book
1324,"Paine's ""Age of Reason"" was a mind-blowing revelation for me, so I'll focus mainly on that in this review. Although he has little formal education (fortunately it doesn't require much to know that hearsay, even the printed variety, is not always accurate), Paine is a brilliant independent thinker who advocates critically and intelligently evaluating the Bible. He dismisses the need to insist on divine explanations for what is simply the warlike, violent behavior of a typical tribal society, and shows his unique ability to filter the positive aspects of Biblical teaching (i.e. kindness, mercy, regard for one's neighbors) from the more mythological aspects of it (creationism, the fall of Satan, etc.).While it can be argued that because none of us have physically met Thomas Paine and thus have no reason to believe that he is truly the author of these works (just as we have never met Jesus and have no reason to believe that he said or did anything recorded in the Bible), this doesn't really matter. Just like Paine points out that he can take the positive aspects of Jesus' teachings and employ them whether or not he believes in Jesus himself, so can we take the positive aspects of Paine's writings and employ them whether or not we believe that he ever existed.Another thing about ""Age of Reason"" that I found particularly gripping is Paine's ability to focus on the big picture regarding nature, rather than the individualized picture. That is, while nature may not seem fair to each of us individuals who suffer and are unhappy, it is fair in a larger sense. While no other species but humans have developed the technology to (mostly) beat the system, for every species there is a species which it preys upon and which preys upon it. Until humans developed the scores of vaccines and weapons and mass production of food that we have, we were just as much a part of this natural balance as any other creature. Every species was equally liable to suffer extinction or overpopulation, and one's rising or falling were based on simple natural laws that applied to everyone -- there is no magic. It is this ""justice"" that, I believe, Paine was talking about, not that there is no pain or struggle. Every species has both a degree of robbing, raping, and killing, as well as a degree of giving, nurturing, and reproducing. It's all part of the cycle, and while it is painful, it is neither good nor bad.Anyway, though Paine tends to go off on nitpicking Biblical tangents, the underlying point of Age of Reason is fairly straightforward: the various fallacies and cruelties of the Bible do reveal it as simply another human manuscript, no more divine and no less insightful than any other, and one can and should glean the good while straining out the bad, feeling no obligation to piously swallow it all whole if one does not agree. Or, in a phrase: think critically.",book
1325,"Thomas Paine was one of our founding fathers, was a ""true child of the Enlightenment"" and believed in the primacy of reason. Through his writings, especially ""Common Sense,"" and ""The American Crisis"" (""these are the times that try men's souls,"") he became the ""voice"" of the American Revolution.He was a brilliant writer who appealed to a mass audience and was far ahead of his time. Carl Sagan tells us that he ""courageously opposed monarchy, aristocracy, racism, slavery, superstition and sexism when all of these constituted the conventional wisdom.""In ""The Rights of Man"" he defended the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution against the conservative Edmund Burke.He turned his attention to religion in the ""Age of Reason"" and it remains his most controversial work. While he does briefly discuss Islam (which he calls the ""Turkish"" church), the book is mainly a long polemic against Judeo-Christianity and, especially, a critique of the ""holy"" books of those religions viz. The Old Testament, The New Testament and the Epistles of St. Paul. It is a tour de force and deserves an honored place in the library of those who believe that all the religions of man are human inventions, all are part of human evolution, and none of them have any supernatural content whatsoever.It is better to read Paine in his own words so here, for your edification, are a few ""Gems from the Age of Reason."" Unfortunately it is only possible to scratch the surface in this short review.Old Testament - ""Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more half the bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God.""Books of Moses -""The five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are spurious and Moses is not the author of them. Still further, they were not written in the time of Moses, not till several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived; and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of Moses; as men now write histories that heppened, or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago.""New Testament - ""The presumption is that the books called the evangelists and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and that they are impositions. The disordered state of the history of these four books, the silence of one book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the productions of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called the apostles are supposed to have done.""Jesus Christ - ""Had it been the object or intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his lifetime. But there is no publication extant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New Testament were written after his death. . . . These books do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes about him. It appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it is only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering questions. . . .From this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years. Where he lived or how he employed himself during this period,is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not apear that he had any school education, and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor.""St. Paul - ""The character of the person called St Paul, according to the accounts given of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism. He had persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards. The stroke he had received, had changed his thinking wihout altering his constitution; and, either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot. Such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach. They are always in extremes, as well of action as of belief.""Invented religions - ""All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish appear to me to be no other than human inventions set up to enslave and terrify mankind and monopolize power and profit. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.""Dark Ages - ""Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the Age of Ignorance commenced with the Christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterward.""Morality - ""As to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered in the old and new testaments they make no part of this pretended thing, revealed religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience and bonds by which society it held together, and without which it cannot exist, and are nearly the same in all religions and all societies. In revealed religion morality is banished to make room for an imaginary thing called faith.""Mystery - ""the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is the fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion.""To Thine Own Self Be True - ""I do not condemn those who believe in established religions. They have the right to their beliefs. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.""",book
1326,"It does not get any better than this as far as political writing is concerned. Thomas Paine's works are required reading, no other author has moved me so. If you only ever read one author in this line of writing, Thomas Paine is your man. Common Sense started a nation, Rights of Man defined the cause for liberty, Age of Reason gave us clarity. All this from a best selling author that forwent all profit, donating the proceeds to the cause of freedom. Certainly there were greats before him. John Locke, Voltaire, and others stand tall on the stage of history, but Paine delivered the message to the masses. Thomas Paine changed men's hearts and stirred revolutions.

1328,"Compared to the founding fathers like, Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, George Washington etc, today's politicians are like children.In the age of reason Tom Paine does NOT criticize God he does criticises organised religion and how it has been manipulated by the powerful for their own selfish ends. It seems to me that Money is the new religion and like religion before it, it is being manipulated by a few greedy people to the detriment of the majority of the people both American foreign.If one takes the time to read and understand what ""fractional reserve banking"" is, how it works and it's implications then one will know why Thomas Jefferson wrote warning the people of America against the banks and why they must never allow the banks to create the worlds money. Sadly this warning has been ignored and we see the result.I advise the everyone, partially Americans, to read this book with an open mind and other works written by your founding fathers, you may find that the wisdom of these good and clever men an antidote to the half truths on CNN and the rest of the corporate owned media.",book

1330,"This is virtually the ultimate collection on Thomas Paine, the daring revoloutionary in his own right. I have been familar with his writings particularly 'Common Sense' and the 'Rights of Man' and various pamphlets but I had not read his controversial, for the time, ""The Age of Reason'. I had a rebirth in my interest in Paine when listening to Clay Jenkinson discuss Paine during the ""The Thomas Jefferson Hour"". Jenkinson described Paine as a great patriot with his enlightening arguments in 'Common Sense' while 'The Age of Reason' was described as very daring, costing him many of his supporters, for questioning religion. In reason, Paine speakes as deist, believing in a supreme being yet a being that does not intervene in human life or alter the laws of nature. It's an intellectual argument that raises fascinating questions, particularly for the time although Deism had a relatively significant following in parts of the western world. This is a great respource on the writings of Paine, a great book to pull off the shelf and read a particular article. Thus, this compilation provides you pretty much the complete writings of Thomas Paine, certianly the essential Thomas Paine, in a handsome single volume.",book

1337,"I believe this is the most complete collection of Paine's writing out there and it is excellent. First of all the production values of the book itself are outstanding. In the first section of the book are Paine's ""American writings"" including Common Sense and all of the American Crisis publications. These give first of all a historical commentary on the progress or lack of progress of the American Revolution. It also gives a brilliant summary of the intellectual inspiration for the revolution. Finally it shows that the art of political spin doctoring or propaganda was alive and well during that era. The last two sections include "" The Rights of Man"" and ""The Age of Reason"". The Rights of Man is of course Paine's defense of the French Revolution but it is also a surprisingly modern statement of the role of government in providing for the poor, the elderly, and children. The ""Age of Reason"" is Paine's act of political suicide in his attack on the bible. You can decide for yourself what you think of his arguments but the people at the turn of the 18th century certainly were not ready to hear from Paine on this subject. I found the book thought provoking from start to finish and would highly recomment it.",book

Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that &quot;we have it in our power to make the world over again&quot;, and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing &quot;We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way&quot;.

1342,"I first heard about this book via a footnote inMy Story Can Beat Up Your Story: Ten Ways to Toughen Up Your Screenplay from Opening Hook to Knockout Punch. That's because that author presents a streamlined, easy to read and understand version of Dramatica's ""unity of opposites"" theory. My Story... is a great book, right up there with Blake Snyder'sSave The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need, but I was left wanting a bit more in-depth definitions of the ""unity of opposites"" archetypes the author presented. So I got a free pdf from Dramatica's website and tried slogging through it. Ugh!Dramatica is boring, pretentious, and written by eggheads in that annoying ""Look at me! I've been to college and know big, unnecessary words!"" style that is a total turn-off. For the authors supposedly being so smart, it's riddled with typos, confusing terminology not even they can keep straight (red flag: they provide their own massive dictionary of terms!), and it's all a pain in the butt to read.That said, as an adjunct to My Story... Dramatica is a big help IF you found yourself wanting stronger, more detailed archetype definitions. And this is fine at first, providing insights My Story... does not, but then it all gets too detailed with tables and matrixes and multiples of four that left my head swimming. I guess that's where their super-expensive software version comes in handy, but I'm not buying it. It's kind of a red flag that they give the book away in hopes of getting you to buy the software.Yes, I learned some new helpful ideas from Dramatica, so that was awesome, but I basically just strip-mined the book for the unity of opposites stuff and cut and pasted that into my own document, replacing the horribly clunky Dramatica archetype names (like Contagonist) with the easy to say and remember My Story... names (like Deflector).",book
1343,"This is an awesome book! First I want to thank Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntly for thier hard work, creativity and innovation for putting together Dramatica. I have been piecing together a story for the last three years on Microsoft (MS) OneNote with virtual pages of characters, potential scenes and plots, however none of it was organized. It lacked control, consistency and something to gel it together. I recieved Dramatica last Friday and I cannot put it down because the information Dramatica presents is like a transfusion of knowledge going from the page to my brain. How many of you out there ever had one those moments where the intellectual leap is being made in real time as you read and take in rich information? It is like experiecing an on going epiphany being directly wired into your brain. That is what I have been experiencing while reading Dramatica.After reading the first half of the book I immediately fired up my computer, loaded up MS OneNote and started applying some of the concepts the books teaches such as character archtypes, complex characters, objective characters, subjective characters and four story throughlines as it relates to the points of view per the subjective characters. Although my story's structure was maturing, there comes a point in time that MS OneNote just isn't going to be effective as a means to retrieve and to display the information, which I was amassing. I went ahead and purchased the software Dramatica Pro and Storyweaver 3.0.Folks, by writing this review with enthusiasm and mentioning the software, please know that there are no kickbacks taking place between myself, Melanie and Chris. Please understand that I am sharing with you my personal subjective experience using Dramatica and I want to help those who are considering buying Dramatica. With that said, I do suggest in addition to the book purchasing the software Dramatic Pro. Why? As you read the book your mind is taking in alot of information and you may find yourself repeating the reading of chapters two or three times. Its new! Your mind is getting accustomed to a new way of thinking when creating stories. The software complements the book because as you build your story through Dramatica Pro, you are applying the theory taught in the book into practical application. For example, let's say you have read a great deal of the first part of the book, however there are still concepts that seem murky. You have a basic grasp on those murky concepts but you need a solid grasp. Using Dramatica Pro creates that solid grasp because it combines the theory with practical use. Not only are you applying your new skills in Dramatica theory, Dramatica Pro keeps all the information you give it in orderly fashion and has it all ready to display it back in an instant. On the other hand if you use Dramatica Pro without reading the book, you will get an exposure to Dramatica but may deny yourself the theory's depth that the book eagerly desires to give you. Read the book first, at least at the very minimum the first section and then use the software. You will find a satisfying learning experience.If you are considering purchasing the book Dramatica, I believe that you will not be disappointed but at the same time you must also be willing to commit to learning something new, being open-minded about new concepts and be willing to put it to work or practice. Best of luck with your stories fellow creative writers and may you all prosper from your efforts.",book
1344,"I couldn't offer a better review than to reprint my letter of thanks to the authors:Dear Ms. Phillips and Mr. Huntley,As a student of storytelling, admittedly more organic, your book/theory has expanded my understanding of perspectives and throughlines, of story bio-mechanics, more than any other number of books or experiences. My novel, and sequel manuscript, have gone from flat to full, in record time, a little exaggeration - not much. I can not say I am familiar with the nuance of all 64 boxes yet, excuse the juvenile description, but its been like stepping out of the dark.The theory has served more than as a writing tool for me. I find myself applying the principles even to real life situations, and taking/using the perspective of various characters, as the story's perceived and as what's perceived as needed to fix it, to influence the narrative and the outcome. Does that sound nuts? It actually works. I'm not there yet, writing my own story, and never will be I'm certain, but to aspire.Most importantly, you guys have showed me what people really want. - We all want a good story, well told. We want it in the books we read and the movies we watch. We want it in the products we buy and services we receive, the affiliations we maintain and interests we pursue. We want it in the life we live. But more than want, we need stories. Stories are how we learn and understand, how we analyze and formulate decision making strategies (now experimentally proven). Stories are how we make ourselves understood, how we discuss and advance thought. How we win others to our viewpoint, to favorable assessment at least.Thanks again",book
1345,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness.",book
1346,"Although this book was written apparently for aspiring writers and is now given away for free on the internet as a way of promoting the authors' software, I looked at the book as a reader of literature, as a contribution to literary theory and narratology. In such a light the book is quite relevant. The authors take what can only be described as a highly aristotlean approach to literature. In particular, this book almost reads like the work of someone who has been immersed in the works of Richard McKeon for far too long, with its strange fetishism of the number 4 and all of its multiples. In McKeon's work, everything in philosophy can be reduced to four methods, but each method can be associated with 4 possible principles, 4 possible interpretations, and can be applied to 4 possible subject matters, forming a complicated 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 matrix of philosophical possibilities. Here, there is an almost identical structural matrix built around the fetishism of multiples of 4, with 4 possible thematics, each of which can be divided into 4 possible types. 4 kinds of Throughlines. 16 types. 64 variations. 64 elements. For anyone familiar with Richard McKeon's project of ""philosophical semantics"", the ideas presented in this book will seem obvious to the point that I suspect one of the authors may have actually been one of Richard McKeon's students at University of Chicago.It wouldn't be the first time a student of Richard McKeon's becomes a literary theorist. Wayne Booth is famously a student of McKeon's (although this book bears little resemblance to Wayne Booth's works).This also isn't the first time someone has attempted to construct a theory of literature around the McKeonian/Aristotlean fetishisation of the number 4. McKeon's wife, Zahala McKeon, wrote a book in which she attempted to classify all novels into one four categories based on the kinds of ""arguments"" such novels stood for (a reader of ""Dramatica"" will of course recognize the word ""argument"", which reappears here in the form of ""Grand Argument Stories"").Where Zahala McKeon's book was in my opinion largely a failure, however, Dramatica actually accomplishes something. The structural matrix developed around the number 4 is a bit weird at first, but in the end I think it has a great value for readers of literature. For that I think Dramatica is a much better adaptation of McKeon's work than Zahala McKeon's book was.I would have been much more interested to read this book as a serious contribution to professional literary theory discourse, however. By packaging the book as a sort of ""self help"" book for struggling writers or as a promotional piece for selling software licenses to struggling writers, I think the ideas in this book are not being developed optimally. This book makes a contribution to the discussion of how/why we construct and interpret narratives. Too bad you have to get through all the ""How to be a writer"" nonsense to get there.",book
1347,"I've been a hobbyist writer since 2000; but, having recently retired I decided to become serious about writing. A friend suggested I read this book, because as an engineer by training and vocation I am a person who needs to understand a subject before really ""doing"" it. To that end Dramatica is excellent. But, the theory section, some 163 pages, is quite tough slogging. I had to make many notes and turn what I read into my own words to gain full understanding. Was it worth the effort? Yes, absolutely, but if you are not a persistent type person you will never complete the task. The authors themselves on page 78 say, ""This discussion can get theoretical at times, and we present it more for those interested in details, rather than as essential reading."" They are absolutley right.Now, the second half of the book is on the subject of ""The Art of Storytelling."" However, from what I garnered, the art they present is a proprietary one aimed primarily as an adjunct to their writing software ""Dramatica."" I consider the writing process as put forth by the authors as too structured, too complex and too demanding of details. Since a writer's subconscious really does most of his writing and if he lets it loose (he really should) then all his carefully laid plans run the risk of being abandoned. To write an ""honest"" story, one that will grab readers, the writer must be truthful to himself otherwise his readers just stop reading. Will all this structured work as promulgated by the authors hinder or help truthful storytelling? That's for you to decide. Remember Shakespeare, Dickens and Hemmingway didn't take courses on writing, didn't read texts on writing and certainly didn't use writing related computer programs. What they did do was read a lot and write a lot. My conclusion on the Dramatica book is that it's worth the read, but it's not really necessary.",book

1349,"This book, along with the software if you so choose (i have both just so you know), has a LOT of information. My personal feelings are that you should buy it only if you are interested in reading about the craft of writing in your down time. There is so much information, a lot of which is unnecessary in my opinion, that this 'theory' would have you do that it would take you years before you'd actually have the outline of your novel finished, let alone a first draft.Look, every so often someone comes along trying to anaylize and explain the process of something, in this case writing. It sucks inexperienced writers into buying their product simply because they have a way of explaining it in such a tantalizing way but there is NOTHING NEW in what they have to say, only the way that they say it.Yes this book can be helpful but buy it for reading enjoyment only, and then if you're bored and have taken a break from your daily scheduled writing session (something far more valuable that you should be doing which is NOT in this book yet is essential if you wish to be a writer) then maybe on your down time you can figure on trying to integrate some of the info in this book into your writing.Let me put it to you this way: this book teaches you how to assemble a car piece by tiny piece when all you really might be looking for is an instruction book on how to drive. There is NO magical formula for writing and what erks me the most about this book is that is how it is presented. The thing is, one only learns that AFTER they read the book.Borrow it, rent it at the library, buy unless you really want to take years (yes, years. that's how detailed this book is) to actually write your novel then do yourself a favor and do what the great writers have done for centuries; read as much as you can and then take those books that really triggered your imagination and heart and after you finish them just take out a notebook and write down exactly what it is that moved you about the characters, the story and so on. Compare the lists you make from other books and you will eventually see things that stick out. Then use them.Yes, it really is that simple.",book
1350,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is not a book you can skim through, it is a tough, no-nonsense, disciplined approach to creative writing; one that not only requires intense study, but also demands that you lay aside everything else you have ever read about story technique. The payoff is, Dramatica will force you to be the best you can be. Talent isn't enough in today's marketplace. No matter how great the writing, publishers want stories with no plot holes (if they find 'em, you gotta fix 'em and they don't tell you where to look). They want brief yet succint answers to questions like ""who's the audience, what's the premise, the theme, the genre, the plot, etc."" Dramatica will give you that information. Sometimes you'll hear, ""it doesn't quite come together"" which means the structure of your story is weak. That's where Dramatica shines like a lighthouse beacon in a storm. If you use Dramatica properly, underdeveloped structure will never be a problem. Once you have a firm grasp of all the story points you must cover in order to produce a complete and satisfying story, unchain the talent and watch it produce. Does Dramatica stifle creative imagination? Absolutely not! If anything, it throws you into overdrive as you work through the story encoding and story weaving sections. Try it. You'll love it! If you are serious about, and committed to, the stories you want to tell, Dramatica needs to be at your elbow. A word of advice though-once you get the book and/or software, study the Dramatica dictionary of word meanings before you get into the theory; make them automatic thought processes and you'll do just fine. Happy reading. Happy writing.",book
1351,"Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language. Dramatica Theory is the most challenging writing book I never read. It is very interesting but difficult. The authors create new definitions for words, and I often had to pause and go back in the book, to be sure to understand.But I am happy I did this effort. Dramatica Theory offers deep insights about what should be in a story. I think it is useful when you have a story, and you want to explore how to take it at a deeper, more complete level. I think most of writers and screenwriters can really get benefit of this book.",book
1352,"I've read this book before.It's the same old theory you can find in hundreds of other books on the topic of writing craft, except it's been bedazzled with Words That Appear All In Capitals For No Reason, words with alternate (and incorrect) meanings like how it combines ""Archetype"" and ""Stereotype"" into the same word even though those are two very different things, and this book also makes up its own words for things which already have meanings in the English language (too many of THOSE to count!).If you strip away all of the nonsense, all the trying to market itself as something new and fresh, it's the same book you've read before over and over on writing, and therefore it's not TECHNICALLY a bad read in that respect. But those additions, the terrible misuse of the English language, the teaching of words which will only make you confused should you ever read another text on writing and wonder why all the words are different, make this a terrible primer for new writers and confusing as Hell for experienced writers.Don't buy it. Spend those dollars on something more useful, like, any other writing book which uses standard language (but still the same theory!)",book
1353,"I have used Dramatica for years, with my beta-version of this book - copied from the generous website - and I couldn't imagine writing without it. My first published short story has the elegant bare-bones version of the theory tucked into it, and everyone has mentioned how 'complete' it was.The first novel (unpublished) I wrote was BD (before Dramatica) - and readers noted that it took a good third of the book before they really got into it - and then they couldn't put it down. I'm aiming for far better than that with the current novel - grabbing the reader's attention by the first line, and then making sure that new stuff is developed at an attention-holding pace. Dramatica has made me think of so much to write that the story never flags. I can't wait to get it all in a nice clean book form.",book
1354,"I have both the book and the software. The terminology in this theory is sometimes difficult, because it redefines certain words we use commonly to serve its own purposes. For example, Dramatica refers to ""dynamic pairs"" of story elements. Some of them are easy enough to grasp: Order/Chaos, Help/Hinder, etc. But many of the dymanic pairs are more difficult to get, e.g. Possibility/Certainty (one might have expected Possibility/Impossibility) or Obligation/Rationalization (when you understand how the theory defines these terms it makes perfect sense, but at first blush it looks a little odd). But if you put the time into this, the payoff is enormous.(Please also see my review here of Dramatica Pro 4, where I go into considerable detail about the ""contextual"" nature of this theory.)I think the most useful part of the software is the HUGE number of questions it poses to you about your characters, situations, relationships. As I went through the questions regarding my main characters, I realized many times ""Hm, I never thought about that..."" So neither the theory nor the software are providing answers, just lots and lots of questions that you, as the author, are responsible for being able to answer. Even if those answers don't make it directly into your final draft, having those answers will definitely color your take on the way your characters interact with each other and their environment.The software itself is an obsessive-compulsive's dream, I have to say, and especially your first time using it you may find yourself playing with it endlessly (like me). But the characters in my story have nonetheless blossomed into ""real people"" for me in a way I have never experienced before.There is a free PDF version of the book available at the dramatica.com website, but it is an older edition. But if you want to get a sense of how the theory works before buying the book, that might be a good place to start.The Dramatica website itself is a treasure chest of additional information and in depth discussions of certain parts of the theory. There is also an excellent users' forum for both the theory and the software, where you can post your questions. Chris Huntley (one of the authors) is usually very quick to respond and offers excellent input.I strongly recommend that you don't try to use the software without reading the book first. It will make no sense to you otherwise.",book
1355,"First, Dramatica lives up to it's claims: it truly is a unique, new theory of story. That says volumes. I have most of the major Story Structure books out there, representative of all the major schools, and really, there's damn little that's genuinely new or unique in the field. So if you're interested in a new way of looking at story and story structure, this is probably a book worth considering.Second, the people claiming this to be something of a slog to get through are correct. The question isn't, ""does this require effort,"" but ""is the effort worth it; does this new theory of story provide real insight that you can't get from other theories?"" And to that, the answer is, ""Yes."" If you're a student of story, you'll want to be familiar with Dramatica. It's worth it.",book
1356,"THE UP: It's comprehensive. It actually encouraged me to look at a story as a framework, a skeleton, and see how the different parts hinge on one another. For storycrafting, the Dramatica theory can literally help one see holes in plot or characterization, allowing a writer to make more sound creative decisions, if not induce more headaches, towards the creation of a full, robust story. The book even touches on how the theory applies to different genre.THE DOWN. It's comprehensive. The theory puts a label on practically everything--and there are a lot of labels. Though the theory is cleanly presented as a chart, it is still a deep chart. If you don't have the software, appreciating the Dramatica theory can be tedious, if not frustrating. I wonder when the Idiot's Guide will come out?THE GOOD IN-BETWEEN. If you want to look at storycrafting from a different perspective and don't mind a little rattling in your brain, this is a good book. It can enrich what you already know about constructing a full story. However, trying to go through the entire book AND putting it into practice can potentially threaten your writing time. It's not really a practical guide. The Dramatica website has a downloadable PDF version, so you might want to give this a go then decide if you want the hard copy.I would like to see this book have a ""What This Means In The Real World"" section after every chapter, wherein a summary of the key points are presented along with practical tips. Again, the Dramatica theory is eye-opening, but I guess it's meant to be absorbed by a chosen few.",book
1357,"This is a true story of intrigue, betrayal, social engineering gone awry, and oppression in America. Townsend's WWII AND THE AMERICAN INDIAN is primarily aimed at academics-- Native American studies professors in particular-- but this book is a revelation to those not already familiar with the many bizarre goings-on of the American government and its Right-wing critics in the tense years before, during, and after the war. Native American draft resistance, for example, was widespread-- contrary to the image of patriotic Indian, eager to defend ""his"" country.But most interestingly, the hidden question being explored in this work is: ""Is the enemy of my enemy my friend?"" History has forgotten Joseph Bruner, Alice Lee Jemison, and ""Chief Red Cloud,"" Native Americans who were quite willing to ally themselves with outright Nazis (both in America and in Germany) in order to advance their own political agendas. They had an understandable grudge against the BIA, and decided to make a deal with the devil.Fascist crazies like William Dudley Pelley reciprocated, all too happy to advocate Native American Liberation. Pelley even argued that Native Americans should be ""set free"" from their reservations-- to be replaced by American Jews.Roosevelt appointees in the federal government such as John Collier, BIA head, were briefly terrified by such plans, and actively combatted them with propaganda and prosecutorial muscle. They were troubled, in the 30s, by the prospect of a multicultural fascist front-- Gold Shirts from Mexico, Native Americans, German-American Bund members. and pro-Japanese Afro Americans, etcetera-- seizing power. Reading Townsend's book, it becomes clear that their fears were largely justified. What would have happened if the American fascists had succeeded? How would history have changed? Such tantalizing questions fill this book.Townsend tells us that the Germans knew all about Navajo code talkers before the war, and had sent an agent to the Southwest under the guise of an anthropological researcher, to help crack the code. Such German outreach to oppressed peoples in America was a lead-up to WWII.Also, John Collier, controversial BIA head, was one of the main architects behind Japanese American internment during WWII. His policies towards Native Americans were the template for the ""friendly"" Japanese concentration camps, many of which were erected on reservations. Collier, as a liberal, was the sworn enemy of the aforementioned Pelley-- and yet, ironically, both of them advocated concentration camps, albeit with different occupants. Such fascinating, dark ironies abound in Townsend's study. All along the American Indians are treated as pawns or noble primitives or mere symbols by the powers that be, the whites, even though the reader begins to suspect that those powers needed the Indians more than the Indians needed them...One helluva great read.",book
1358,A very academic presentation of policies and attitudes towards Native Americans during WWII. Book focuses much more on policies and beaucratic process than individual Native Americas or their tribes.,book

Natural born storyteller Paul Lepp has the Monster Stick. The Monster Stick, a remarkable fishing pole of mythical proportions, is Paul's nine-foot, surf-casting rod full of six miles of brand new, 50-pound test Stren Carp cord with 20 pound, custom made, stainless steel, slip-sliding sinkers. The Monster Stick, born of magic, baptized in the rivers of West Virginia, and able snag DC-10's or lunker-sized catfish.Meet Paul and Bil Lepp, natural born storytellers and two repeat winners of the West Virginia State Liars' Contest. There's Bil's dog, Buck, a thirty-seven inch irony, whose mother was a German Sheppard, and whose father was a prolific and extremely determined Basset hound. Buck can pull you through a knothole, and hold his own against a monster truck, but is a gun-shy hunting dog who can't track a bunny rabbit in a shoebox. Between the Monster Stick, and Buck, you get an original bunch of hilarious short stories and tall tales that you'll want to share with everyone from your poker buddies to your preacher.The West Virginia State Liars' Contest is held every year on Memorial Day weekend. The contest is only open to West Virginia residents. The ""lies"" should be short stories (humorous, dramatic, supernatural, etc.) with a maximum length of 3 to 5 minutes.

Paul Lepp won six ""Biggest Liar"" titles before his death in 1998, and his brother Bil Lepp has taken first place five times since he first entered in 1990, proving that lightning - or at least lying - does sometimes strike twice.Bil Lep, a former Methodist preacher, has published a collection of stories with his brother called The Monster Stick & Other Appalachian Tall Tales. Generally, the fishing stories are Paul's and the dog tales Bil's. These twenty three tales have lots to offer on women and carp, more than a little on dogs, trains and cars, a considerable amount on hunting, and more politics than shows on the surface. There's plenty to keep a thinking man laughing and awake at night.In his follow-up, Inept: Impaired: Overwhelmed -- Tall Tales from West Virginia and Beyond, Bil Lepp spins more tales of his super-dog Buck, introduces us to his best friend, Skeeter Barth, and keeps a smile on your face with stories about catfish-grabblin', summer camp, moose-trappin', and that misunderstood mishap with the FBI.

1367,"The book discusses the role that knowledge-based experts, otherwise known as ""epistemic communities"", play in international policy coordination. They argue that ""control over knowledge and information is an important dimension of power and that the diffusion of new ideas and information can lead to new patterns of behavior and prove to be an important determinant of international policy coordination."" The first chapter defines what epistemic communities are, how they can be distinguished from other interest groups and the role that they play in helping to identify state interests and formulate policy. In the following chapters, the concept is applied to a diverse range of policy areas to illustrate how the communities affected international coordination. Trade in services, nuclear arms control, whaling, ozone negotiations, food aid, international financial standards, and the American post-war settlement are the policy areas covered. The book is an excellent academic resource if you are interested in epistemic communities, or alternative analysis for international policy coordination, or even if you are just interested in the particular case studies presented. Each case study is a meticulous presentation of historical developments and analysis for the particular policy area. They provide a wealth of information that is extremely useful for understanding the particular policy area, even if you are not particularly interested in the concept of epistemic communities.A word of warning though, if you are not a political scientist or an international relations theorist, this book can be extremely heavy going in parts. Technical jargon abounds, particularly in the first and last chapters. As an example, ""the contributers ... shake orthodoxy by challenging Kantian ontology, correspondence theories of truth and related positivistic claims""(in the preface); and ""epistomologically, the world and our representation of it are not isomorphic."" Fortunately, the case studies are much more understandable and keep away from the jargon.",book

Being one of those Irish, I decided to give it a look. I was delighted!This book which can be appreciated in many ways. I read the surnames of friends and the histories of parishes with which I am familiar. From the pages of this book I developed an appreciation of the contributions of the St. Louis Germans to the religious, commercial and social life of St. Louis. Ever the historian, Fr. Faherty is not satisfied until he explains the developments in Germany which drove its citizens to St. Louis. A consistent explanation is that Bismarck's anti-Catholic policies were a major factor in German immigration to St. Louis.For anyone with an interest in St. Louis, German immigration to America or Church history, ""The St. Louis German Catholics"" is a must.",book
1369,"To me the main value of this book was its advice about dealing with the perfectionism of a gifted child.

I really enjoyed how the author really makes you consider your own background in education and encourages you and your spouse or partner to get on the same page. It also has explained some of my son's behavior. I do have two negatives, though. The first is that it doesn't offer an appendix listing contact resources for gifted parents, like parent support groups and such that can be found around the country. That would be extremely helpful. Also, the author mandates parents really have to expose gifted children to a lot of experiences to maximize their potential. This could include travel, museum visits, and even extra classes. This all adds up to a lot of money that may not be available to all parents of gifted children. A parent in that situation may be discouraged by reading this book, especially since the case studies seem to all involve more wealthy parents.

1378,"Raising Gifted Kids starts off well, describing the support it will offer us later. Sounds good. But the book goes off track quickly.Klein talks about test scores, describing scores, standard deviations, and descriptions from various tests and test versions, apparently as old as 1970's versions, interchangeably. But they're not interchangeable, and mixing them up this way will confuse parents who don't have another source of testing information, and don't understand the differences between old and modern test versions, and between one modern test and another.Klein then offers a number of vignettes, which vary from predictable to extreme. These are not supportive because no matter what, the parents are the bad guys. After the introduction talking about all the help and support Raising Gifted Kids will offer us, this chapter tells us how awful we are, and all our good intentions are wrong. Pick a specific gifted school for your child? Wrong. Send your gifted child to public school? Wrong. Live in an isolated rural area and homeschool your gifted child? Very wrong. And lots more. Throughout the vignettes, the psychologist knows the single right answer for each child after only an assessment.The rest of the book seems more positive, but has it's confusing moments. All gifted kids are not alike educationally or emotionally, and the sweeping generalizations are too grand. More mistaken impressions left behind, especially among parents who are reading for support.Parents are, for the most part, doing a good job raising their gifted children. Those who aren't, aren't going to read a book about what we need to know - they already know they're doing a perfect job. Good parents need understanding and support. That's why we're buying a book called Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive.Like our kids, we parents of the gifted don't need someone to tell us how bad we are, how all our choices are wrong. We need someone to point out what we're doing right, and what we can do better. That's the kind of support we need. That's what Raising Gifted Kids should have given us.",book
1379,"Although I was able to find some good information in this book, overall I found it frustrating.The author makes sweeping generalizations like, ""All gifted kids are ____"" or ""All private schools are _____."" I was left with the feeling that she thinks she, personally, is the only person qualified to make decisions about gifted kids. There was just no faith that parents know what is best for their kids or that schools genuinely want to help.Her chapters on school selection did not reflect my experience at all. (My kids both attend a terrrific public ""Gifted Center"" school, and we have found the people there responsive, warm, and very very good at what they do.)Some of the advice is painfully obvious. Don't, for example, say to your child, ""Your weird questions are going to send me to an early grave."" (I bet you already knew not to do that.) There were also some problems with the writing and some typos or oversights that gave the book an amateurish feel.Having said all that, I must admit that there were times when a paragraph seemed to be talking about my child or my experience, and a few things were astute enough that I read them aloud to my husband. Thus the second star.But overall, the author, while clearly very bright, came across as bossy and inflexible with very clear prejudices. Why, for example, did she feel the need to point out what high-powered careers and high-status backgrounds all the parents came from? Does she believe gifted kids are only born into wealthy families? It almost felt like name-dropping.Bottom line? I'm very glad I didn't have to buy the copy I read. I've definitely read other, better books on this topic.Pick a different book.",book
1380,"There is much to like about ""Raising Gifted Kids"". The author offers some very helpful advice for those of us facing the challenge of raising an intellectually gifted child. I particularly appreciate her focus on being a ""good enough"" parent rather than trying to be a ""perfect"" one.The biggest issue I had with Dr. Klein is her elitist tone. She is an educational consultant who obviously has a well-heeled client&egrave;le. The impression she gives in her book is that all gifted kids come from affluent families, which is not the case. She describes each of the parents profiled in the book as ""So-and-so, a successful/prominent/stellar/up-and-coming/etc. investment banker/attorney/surgeon/executive/etc."" The parents' occupations are not relevant to the point she's trying to make, so why even mention them? She also has a tendency to mention luxury items in passing as if they're a normal part of everyday life. Perhaps everyone in Dr. Klein's social circle has a housekeeper and a gardener and takes travel ""adventures"" and enrolls their kids in multiple enrichment classes. But I personally found her elitist tone very off-putting.",book
1381,"The author surprisingly is not a know-it-all but rather an astute observer of ""high-potential"" or ""gifted"" children. If you are a gifted adult you may find yourself wishing you had this kind of astute parenting! This book will enable many mothers and fathers (and grandparents) to help give the children in their care rich and rewarding lives. Your kids don't have to be geniuses for them to benefit from the author's experience.",book
1382,"It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.",book

1384,"I gave this book one star because the author, in the beginning of the book, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. That is one of the reasons I bought the book and some of the information was useful.Now, on to the rest... Upon reading this material, I found it to be a self pat on the back from the author on her impressive portfolio of wealthy clients. I found plenty of information if I were an extremely rich person living in a community where the schools for the gifted were plentiful. All of her clients were fabulously well to do and their children were profoundedly gifted. So what about the rest of us? My husband is gainfully employed and I am a student. We have a modest income and our son is gifted. We found little practical advice for ordinary working parents. If you gross less than $200,000 a year, I would try another book.",book
1385,"""Raising Gifted Kids"" was the first book I read that described gifted children, and it did have some interesting insights that got my mind thinking, but I find that overall, I finished the book feeling full of anxiety about what to do with my child. Subsequent books I have read, have given me a fuller picture of the issue and have shed light on the shortcomings of this book. I have a hard time recommending it.This book is filled with anecdotes about gifted children. The stories more or less fall into two patterns. In the ""warning"" stories the pattern is ""Child A was gifted. His parents pushed him too hard. He became a perfectionist, and killed himself as a teenager."" Or ""Child A was gifted. His parents never challenged him enough. He became frustrated with the difficulties of higher education, so wound up becoming an elementary school teacher (as if that meant his life was a failure)"".The ""success"" stories are generally along the lines of ""Child 'A' was gifted. Her parents hired a psychological advisor, so that they knew the right thing to do. The child became a doctor, and they all lived happily ever after."" Since the author is one of these psychologist experts, the general emphasis on finding professional help comes across as very self serving. The author's subtle, though persistent implications that some career paths are not worthy of ""gifted"" children comes across as elitist and narrow minded.I have since read a few other gifted children books, and I have learned that there are more or less two camps when it comes to gifted children. There are some who believe that giftedness is an indication that a child has a genetic gift that ""should"" lead that child to grow into a super-achieving adult. This is the type of gifted child model this book talks about. The author puts a lot of emphasis on the idea that if your gifted child doesn't grow up to be an exceptional world changing adult, that somehow the parents have not done a proper job raising the child.The second camp, and the one that the very helpful book ""Being Smart About Gifted Children"" covers well, is that it is often healthier for the child if parents and educators approach giftedness as a temporary state and spend time addressing any current difficulties that a child's giftedness might bring about. For example, if a child is suddenly finding 2nd grade math to be boring, figure out how to make it exciting. To be avoided, though, is to burden a child with a label, just because they happen to be really good at math at a young age. Often it is the case that giftedness does NOT result in a super-achieving adult, and that is perfectly normal.",book
1386,"I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one.",book
1387,"I found this book extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. The book has great insight and information, plus plenty of real-world examples of how parents deal with issues unique to gifted children. One puzzling thing, though, was the notion that there's an anti-gifted bias and that parents of gifted children are somehow seen by educators as meddlers or pushy parents. The author also seems to have the idea that public schools don't know how to deal with gifted children. That hasn't been my experience so far (our public school has an excellent GT & HGT program) and don't expect it to be as my children get older.",book

James Moore went all Casey Kasem on him and tried to trump HIS list. Anyway, it's your call, but I think I'm sticking with the list that dates back to B.C. and has guided the morals of man ever since, while playing a major role the development of early legal systems which has an impact present in almost all forms of modern law and faith.Nice try James Moore.",book
1394,"Nowadays everyone has heard of the genetic code (in the singular). There is a certain amount of confusion in many people's minds, encouraged by the journalistic use of the phrase ""genetic code"" to mean what a biologist would call the genome, i.e. the complete DNA sequence for an individual. Nonetheless, there are plenty of good sources, ranging from the highly technical to the popular, to clarify the matter for those who want to be set straight.Marcello Barbieri is talking about something different, that is not only little known to the general public, but is also far less well known among biologists than it deserves to be. For him ""codes"" is plural, and he means more than just the familiar set of rules that say, for example, that when the triplet AAA occurs in an appropriate context in the DNA of a cell the aminoacid lysine needs to occur in the sequence of the corresponding protein. For Barbieri this is just one of numerous organic codes. Some of the others are also ""genetic"", in the sense that they involve reading more from DNA sequences than just aminoacid sequences, but others are not, as they involve information coded into structures such as sugars and histones that are not nucleic acids.All this should have considerable interest for the biologist even if we just stop there, but Barbieri goes on to build a theory of evolutionary complexity on the existence of multiple codes. Each time a new code appears during evolution it allows a large jump in the complexity of the organisms that possess it, but it does not replace earlier codes, which continue to be used, and it does not cause the simpler organisms to disappear. Thus modern organisms constitute a sort of pyramid in which the simplest organisms, the bacteria, use the ordinary genetic code and nothing else. The simplest eukaryotes add to the complexity by using splicing codes as well -- still in the genetic material, but now allowing fragments to be combined in different ways, and thus interpreted in different ways. The most recent of his codes to appear in evolution is language, which distinguishes our own species from all the others.",book
1395,"This book has a germ of an idea, but overall the author's exposition is confused and unconvincing. The big idea is that life is a set of organic codes and that codes imply meaning, hence the &quot;semantics&quot; in the title. Barbieri attemps to show that codes are necessary mappings between domains that e.g. allow information stored in the genome to be translated into the organism through development. A key point is that the genome contains insufficient information to fully describe the organism. From this, the author posits codes for other processes, e.g. exon splicing and signal transduction, although he offers no evidence and just suggests biologists haven't looked for them. He also tries to use his ideas to &quot;explain&quot; evolution, especially the Cambrium explosion of phyla.I found his ideas unconvincing. His ideas rest on his model of how complexity needs to be generated, based on algorithms to reconstruct CAT scan images. He uses a new term &quot;convergent increase in complexity&quot; to mean &quot;reconstructing a structure from incomplete information&quot;, which is based on these CAT scan image algorithms. However, a wealth of literature on cellular automata (finite state machines) shows that complexity can be generated by simple rules. Furthermore, repeatable, complex structures can be observed by these processes. If one needs convincing about this, just look at the biomorph images in Dawkins' &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; for taste of how simple rules can create complex, &quot;body plans&quot;. L-systems are another example.But despite his claims, Barbieri does not really offer falsifiable hypotheses and for this reason alone, it is difficult to understand how anyone can build on this work as a model of biology.Rather than thinking of codes as means to map information spaces, other workers have followed more fruitful approaches, e.g. how codes are used in information theory as a model to understand the biology. What is apparent from computational science, e.g. Holland's work on tagging systems, and wet biology, is that life needs to have systems that co-ordinate. Co-ordination becomes increasingly difficult as organisms increase in complexity and size. Biology seems to indicate that many approaches to communication used in industry have their surrogates in living systems.Barbieri comes over as a little petulant that his ideas have not be taken up by biologists. A quick search on the web showed that only people involved in a &quot;discipline&quot; called biosemiotics had looked at his work, and these texts reinforced the sense that incomprehensibity was used to mask lack of content. I hope I have given some reasons why this might be so.In conclusion, although I found this book in a biology section, it might have been better placed with the humanities.",book
1396,"The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press.",book

1417,"Interesting anecdotes of a white man living among the indians, the hardships and struggles, but it's obviously a biased tale. Quite a stretch for the reader to believe that a man- Texas Ranger no less- would be unable to ""escape"" before 3 years. Personally I don't believe it. Anyway, while one reviewer highlights a particular commanche torture to an infant, it's best to keep everything in perspective and acknowledge the extreme brutality whites displayed against all tribes in the western hemisphere- for example, Sand Creek, Wounded Knee. That said, if you like stories similar to this, try Nat Love's autobiography.",book

Morison is well known, of course, for the Times New Roman face - and there is a section in the book on that face. But his commentary on the designing of faces like Plantin and Bembo is much more interesting, if you ask me. Also, if you are at all a fan of Eric Gill, you will like the section on Perpetua and Felicity. Anyone interested in the history of type should have this book, that much is certain.",book
1419,"Typography may be unique among arts in its historical ties to commerce. Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use. If you already appreciate that subtle art, if you want to learn more about its history and practice, this is a very enjoyable way to learn.",book
1420,"The previous Amazon post giving a 1-star rating is an aberration and clearly misguided. The particular argument in the book that the poster points out as faulty has to do with showing how a mortgage isn't really the tax shelter most people think it is. The problem in simplifying the concept for the average busy person is that more sophisticated readers (but clearly not experts) can misconstrue the intent as being deceptive. I won't say much more about the poster other than that they're partly right if they're complaining about simple comparisons being potentially misleading, but are 100% wrong in their understanding of why it was important for the author to keep things short and simple (H.Gill apparently has a Masters in Education and I suspect knows his audience quite well).I read the same section, and immediately realized that the argument could be taken further on my own without the author's assistance. The author makes it clear he felt he needed to address a common and simple argument one might hear from a layman about mortgage interest rates and taxes. He then delivered a simplified answer in a similar context, and moved on to the actual education that you paid for and that he expands on expertly. After reading the book (really a large pamphlet, which in actuality is a GOOD thing) you'll realize that you have some work to do. However, after designing and adapting your own financial model to your particular situation, I can't imagine that you would need anything more than a good spreadsheet, and some discipline to keep it updated. The concepts (I count three major ones) are near brilliant in their out of the box thinking and synthesis.",book
1421,"These kind of books drag out their point like a movie with a thin plot. The point can be summed up in a paragraph or two. Take a home equity line credit (HELOC) in the amount of your paycheck and make a one time payment to your mortgage. Thereafter, charge all of your living expenses to the HELOC, and pay it off with your paycheck. I checked, and the interest rate on HELOCs is about 10%. So, you are saving interest on a one tme extra payment in the amount of your paycheck, and then paying 10% on the average balance in your HELOC. Even if there is no interest if you pay the balance off by the next due date, your interest savings is the one shot extra payment to your mortgage. Certainly not enough to cut the term of your mortgage by years. OH, while your at it, take all your spare cash and throw it at your mortgage. Lose your job or have unexpected expenses? Hey, just charge it to that high interest rate HELOC. Makes no sense to me. If I am missing something, I am open to being convinced ... someone please send me a spreadsheet with some hard numbers, not pages of pie in the sky stores! I prefer to invest my spare cash in investment grade bonds of several companies maturing in 6 months or so, and just keep rolling over the investments. E-trade has an excellent platform for doing this. I think I have a good idea if a company will survive and keep paying their bonds in the next 6 months.",book

1425,"I read the book and I still don't see the concept of getting a HELOC. According to the book using the example given you take out a $10,000 HELOC, you then take $5,000 and make a lump sum payment toward the principle of your mortgage along with your normal monthly payments. You then have to payback that $5,000 you just used from the HELOC till your back at $10,000 then you do it all over again. Reducing the principle reduces your mortgage quicker and you pay less interest over the life of the mortgage. Meanwhile, how ever long it takes you to payback the $5,000 to your HELOC your getting charged interest while paying back the $5,000.Lets say for example you have a savings account with $10,000. You then take $5,000 and make a lump sum payment toward the principle of your mortgage along with your normal monthly payments. You then start putting money back into your savings account meanwhile your getting interest on the savings in your account. When your back to $10,000 in your savings account you do it all over again. Again, reducing the principle reduces your mortgage quicker and you pay less interest over the life of the mortgage.Now can someone explain it to me. What's the difference? Whether you do a HELOC or a savings account the outcome is the same. You have to be disciplined in saving your money and making lump sum payments toward your mortgage principle. The only difference I see is if you don't pay back the HELOC you can lose your home.",book

1428,"Sometimes I think there is no hope for America! All this back and forth over a single, simple math concept is annoying because it speaks to the fact that too many of us are too lazy to figure things out for ourselves.First, you need to know how a mortgage is structured; specifically, you need to understand that when you make a mortgage payment, you first pay interest on the outstanding balance and whatever amount is left over is applied against the principle. What that means in English is that the sooner it is in the term of your mortgage, the more interest you pay.Any amount of principle you pay in advance will lower the total amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan and shorten the term of the loan, as well. The amount to prepay being bandied about here is $10,000 and if you were to pay that amount in year one of your mortgage (30yr/6%), you would avoid appx $40,000 in interest charges and shorten the term of your loan by almost seven years!Do the math, knuckleheads!I cannot in good faith, however, recommend the system detailed in this book for most people simply because the level of self-discipline, bookkeeping, and, yes, math required by it is too high for most of us. And, for most of us, taking on additional debt in the form of a HELOC is too risky and unnecessary, besides, to accomplish the goal of paying off your mortgage sooner rather than later.If you want to have mortgage debt for as little time as possible, simply buy only as much house as you can afford using a 15 year mortgage. However, that must be too simple for most people. And people usually fail to follow that advice because they want to buy more house than they can actually afford; in other words, they lack the self-discipline to learn or apply basic personal financial management techniques and strategies much less the skills that will be required to pull off the strategy in this book![...]",book
1429,"I learned about this in January 2007. I started using the concepts and the software in February 2008. I've paid all my revolving credit off and have started reducing the principal on my primary mortgage. I'm so grateful for what this has done for me that I've started holding free, no catch, no strings, no solicitation seminars to teach people the concept. This concept does two things: 1. helps you come to terms with your household cash flow 2. takes that knowledge and teaches you how to pay off all your debts (credit cards, loans and mortgage). The concept is based on math. It will cost you nearly nothing to try, you'll get immediate results, and if you don't like it you can stop and you will have lost nothing - not even the cost of the book or software because if you try the system just once - you will have saved so much in interest it will have more than paid for all costs!

1434,"Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.",book
1435,"This book was a simple and quick read so feel free to make your own conclusions, but I can't agree with all the other evaluators. This book provides nothing more than an avenue to sell a product. Like the author states the concept is not rocket science, but to separate truth from reality in this book is rocket science. It would take some explaining to clarify the point of the book. An example of a non-truth can be found in the first few pages. The author sets up 2 individuals and claims they are equal. Then he states that one has no mortgage and one does. Then uses the numbers to show how having no mortgage is better. The problem is if the two were equal then the one without the mortgage would have to have an equivalent amount in cash or investments. If that amount made the same as the interest on the mortgage then the one with the mortgage would would have come out ahead and would be equal if they had to pay taxes on the invested gain in the future. The assumption is poor. Decisions like this should be based on your financial outlook, risk tolerance, and future goals. Not a program that isn't really a program at all.",book
1436,"I also saw Harj at Millionaire School in 2006 and he was great.One of the previous reviewers called the book deceptive and even pointed out an example from the book:""The author sets up 2 individuals and claims they are equal. Then he states that one has no mortgage and one does.""He must not have read the book very carefully.""Then uses the numbers to show how having no mortgage is better.""What the book actually used that example for was to show that the tax deduction for mortgage interest paid alone is not worth maintaining a large balance on your mortgage. The tax deduction will help ease the pain, but it will never make up for the money you spent paying interest. A house is definately a great investment but why pay more more money in interest than you have to?This is a revolutionary book. In fact, it's already revolutionized the Australian banking industry.I've implemented this system already. I opened a new HELOC account (no application fee or closing costs required). I have not cut down on my expenses or factored in any increases in my income, nor am I refinancing my current mortgage.All told, my investment to make this work was the $25 for the book and that was it.How much will I be saving? $236,445___________________The traditional wayInterest rate: 6.250%Time left on mortgage: 28 yearsMy current mortgage amount: $285,000Total cost of interest: $323,996Total cost of the mortgage: $609,318______________________Using Harj's SystemInterest rate (same): 6.250%Time to pay off: 11 years, 5 monthsTotal cost of interest: $88,943Total cost of the mortgage: $371,480________________________________Total Time Saved: 19 years 7 monthsTotal Interest Saved : $236,445My only caveat is if you are going to use this system, you need to be disciplined enough to track your expenses monthly and stick to that.

1437,"This is definitely a 'must have' book for anyone who owns a home, wants a home, has a mortgage, has debts, doesn't have debts but wants to increase their investments, or, ahhh, did I leave anyone out? Heck, my mom, with just a bit of cash from selling the family home, could profit from this book even though she doesn't now have a mortgage!What I really liked about &quot;Own Your Home Years Sooner!&quot; was the simple, step-by-step explanations of what could have been complicated financial hoo-hah to some of us, myself included. Usually I pass this type of stuff to my 'former banker' husband. But even I could understand how Harj's system works and was even able to talk to others about it in a coherent fashion.If you are considering any of those bi-weekly or weekly payment plans and the like, you MUST read this. The author gives a great rundown on these programs and how they work (or don't work).I read the first edition and talked with the author too and know he has even more helpful chapters planned for us. Be sure to see his website for the latest updates.It's a quick easy read, but you'll be referring back to it as the potential of it begins to sink in. You really can own your own home sooner.As I do not yet have a mortgage (we are looking for a home and mortgage right now), there was not a lot of specific advice for first time home buyers. Talking with the author, he really wrote the book for people with mortgages, but with the 80-100% LTV loans now available in the US, he may have to add yet another chapter to this book for us on the purchasing side.Even without the specific advice, I was able to talk rather intelligently with a mortgage company owner using the lingo I learned in the book and that itself was worth the cost of the book! Now we also know what to look for in a mortgage as we shop. Get it, read it, apply it. It's simple really.P.S. If you are a mortgage broker, PLEASE get this book so you can really help your clients 'own their own home sooner'. I am sure they will thank you by rewarding you with lots of referrals!",book
1438,I found this book &quot;How To Own Your Home Years Sooner&quot; very clear and easy to read. While reading about numbers can be very dry I found Mr. Gill's humor added a lot of fun and a few laughs. The concept on how to own your home sooner is brilliant and simple really if you're willing to keep your focus on your goal. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is paying a mortgage and let each person decide for themselves if it's right for them. I personally bought two copies and gave them to my children who are both paying on mortgages. Happy reading.,book
1439,This is a great book. I had a mortgage broker look at it and he thought it was a good program--the only drawback he saw to it was that it would take discipline. By the way don't pay $80 for this book from 3rd parties. Go to the author website[..],book
1440,"This entire book could be summed up in 10 pages. It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short. After reading numerous message boards on the subject, this book tought me nothing new. It really feels like an informercial that I paid for.",book
1441,"The bank officer crouched below the top of her carrel wall, leaned toward me across the desk and whispered, ""THIS IS BRILLIANT!"" I'd just explained Harj Gill's idea so she could help me with some transfers.I heard Harj speak at Millionaire School (see T. Harv Eker and Secrets of the Millionaire Mind). I bought his book immediately, knowing it would be the best $25 I'd ever spent on wealth creation. If we continue at the pace of the last four months, the remaining 28 years on our dream home in Sedona will be reduced to 5 years and 3 months.How does this create wealth? Which would you rather have? Tax-deductible interest payments or high-yield, tax-liable interest earnings? Duh! Our $240,000 interest savings will be invested in wealth-creation opportunities, such as more properties.In case you're wondering, No, this isn't about paying twice a month or making an extra payment each year. Those techniques will help, but not as much as Harj's approach. So, combine what you already know with this step-by-step, easy-to-read guide, and you'll be a land baron before you know it!",book
1442,"A great concept but the book doesn't show you step-by-step how to implement it; Instead it just encourages you to purchase the authors subscription-based software. My wife and I have implemented these ideas and found them highly effective. However, they are also highly risky concepts if you don't have total control over your budget. Otherwise you could end up in even more debt than you began with.",book
1443,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but now, I think this book is a must read if you want to STOP paying more interest on your mortgage than you have to. What I liked about it is that it takes a potentially complex subject and makes it extremely easy to understand. The book reads as if the author is engaging you in a one-on-one. conversation. By the time you finish reading it you realize that the price of you not implementing this system will cost you tens of thousands of dollars in interest that you never have to pay.I also attended a weekend workshop facilitated by the author and that really brought home the power of this system. I walked away knowing exactly how much time and interest I'm going to save on my mortgage because we created our own individualized plan. I'm telling everyone I know to do this because it certainly changed my life. If you get a chance get this book and attend the workshop - they are run by American Mortgage Eliminators. Hope this helps you.",book
1444,"Never before have I read or even heard of anything like the information that is in this book. It is the most comprehensive, straight-forward and informative book I have read about mortgage reduction. And perhaps the most miraculous thing about this book is that it is not boring!Haha...and there are some really cool and inspirational quotes. (for all you quote lovers....)There is also great online support for anyone who desires additional coaching and support after reading the book and taking the next step in owning their homes sooner.I did some checking on the Author (Harj Gill) before I bought the book and came to realize he has already sold over 150,000 copies of his book in his old home of Australia before moving here to the U.S. a few years ago and creating his U.S. Edition of this book. I also read alot of positive editorials about his mortgage reduction strategies and, after reading the book, I understand why they have been so positive. This book is a must read for anyone (with common sense) who wants to take control and build an aggressively growing Asset base...not to mention, save thousands of dollars in interest.",book

One question that will really make this very clear is this: IF you could have one million dollars right now OR a penny doubled every day for the next 30 days, which would you take? The million dollars right? Think again, you are completely WRONG and now you have the banks secret!!! The penny doubled every day on Day 30 is $5,368,709.12!

1450,"I have recently finished Harj Gill's book and found it to be very enlightening, easy to understand and full of common sense. I have spoken with Harj multiple times on the phone and can personally attest to his credibility, intelligence and character. This knowledge should be implemented into the curriculum at the high school and college level but I think a few bankers might try and keep that from happening.I have just started the program and am excited to prove to the naysayers how much I will save.I spent over 2 months doing research on this very topic having talked with 10 different vendors with a similar program. If you have common sense and can open your mind from the tunnel that you currently find it in, you may just be able to exercise this principle and save yourself quite a bit of money over the long term and be debt free.If you read this book and have discipline in your list of attributes, you will not be disappointed.Brice BenefielExecutive Recruiter",book
1451,"Mr. Gill provides you with critical information about the mathematics of your mortgage and your checking account that you literally can not afford to ignore. He explains the power of leveraging your paychecks to reduce interest charges and shows how that technique can then drastically reduce the term of your mortgage. Yes, you do need to have the discipline to create a budget and stick to it, but you really must do that regardless because, as they say, ""failing to plan is planning to fail"". To simplify the process, he also provides an optional budgeting and payment software package that is thousands less than a similar product marketed by United First Financial.",book
1452,An excellent idea for responsible home owners with positive cash flow. I wish I knew about it 10 years ago. But now it's even better time. If you don't want to be up side down start the program asap.,book

Simply just the way I do my banking. The $25 book will pay itself a thousand fold over and over again. When I pay off my mortgage I will have saved over $90,000 in interest. I will be paying my mortgage about 17 years before its original scheduled date.Harj Gill has opened my eyes, and completely changed the way I handle my finances. I've been following the system for almost 2 years and have managed to pay off all of my debt with the exception of my mortgage.",book
1454,I am excited about the opportunity to put the concepts of this book into action. I was looking at utilizing a firm to purchase a program to assist me in paying off my mortgage early. I have a suspicion that it was going to be quite expensive. The price of the book is probably lot less than what it could be. I am in the banking industry and find the concepts of this book both intriguing and workable. I basically discovered this book because my wife was skeptical about paying off our mortgage early. I believe that this book will qualm her fears and we can look forward to saving thousands of dollars off the interest on our mortgage. I did not rate this book five stars because it does not give you the nuts and bolts of the program.,book

The only problem is that they charged $3,500 to sign up for their program. Thankfully I didn't sign up and instead found this book on Amazon which uses the same principles that they described which saved me $3,500!One of the examples in the book is to sign up for a HELOC (home equity line of credit) and use that to start paying down your principle on your mortgage. The book goes through some straight forward examples using these principles to help you get a grasp of the concept.Well, I just signed up for a HELOC (kinda tough in these times to get approved) and am now in the process of saving thousands of dollars.

1458,"This book uses over a 100 pages to explain a concept that really only fills a couple chapters. That said, I read it in a day and what's an author to do, you can't charge $24 for a 30 page manuscript. So, the rest is pretty much advertising for the author's web site. Unfortunately, you are left with a strong impression after reading that you need to sign up on the website to move forward with the ideas. For some, this can be done at no cost, others will have to pay and that makes it feel a little like a scam.However, this book is not just a moneymaking trick. The system described and some of the other tips for accelerating your mortgage sound really sensible and I plan to see if I can begin using the system right away. But I can't give the book 5 stars cause there's just too much filler and marketing and it also does not provide examples of his system working for families with larger mortgages ($300k+) and salaries ($100k+).",book
1459,"When you understand that banks are interested in making money -- LOTS of it -- for themselves, you'll understand why this book was written. It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground. Harj writes clearly and simply without talking down to you. He lays it all out from beginning to end, and everywhere in between.More than worth the INVESTMENT in your life. Definitely read it.",book

For example, aspects of insurance and law are covered to provide people with an understanding of how all the areas of owning real property come together to provide safety. The system is new and will be done by millions once financial freedom is realized.",book
1462,".....if it is a small mortgage this system is really not of much use. Before you naysayers boo me on this please read on. I have run the numbers doing a simple extra payment plan equal to paying off the HELOC that this book recommends you use. First of all you need to know the theory. The theory is simple. YOu get a HELOC (you need to have equity in the property you are attempting to eliminate/accelerate.) If your home was purchased prior to the drop in real estate values then the 10%, 15% or 20% you put down has vanished so you don't have a way to get a HELOC because the HELOC requires that you have equity in your home. YOu also have to qualify for the HELOC with a financial institution. This would require you to have extra income to be able to pay for your HELOC payments along with your usual mortgage payments. An example you would be you taking out a $15,000 HELOC. In the first month of your mortgage you take out $10,000 from your HELOC and you throw that at your mortgage along with your first month's mortgage payment. This reduces your mortgage by the total of the $10K plus your monthly payment. You now have reduced your mortgage balance by quite a bit and thereby eliminated a lot of interest you would have to pay. Next you spend the next 6 months replacing that money by making 6 payments of $1666.66(actually a bit more depending on your interest rate) per month thereby taking your HELOC balance owed back to zero. You then throw another $10,000 again from your HELOC along with that month's payment at your mortgage again and you do it all over and over until your mortgage is gone. Depending on the size of your mortgage your mortgage will be gone in well under half the 30 years that you were scheduled to pay (360 months.) Remember that you still have to make your usual monthly payments every month. Now if you just happen to have even more extra money then you can throw that money at your mortgage too and that will save you a pile of interest and thereby pay off your mortgage even sooner. The reason you don't use all of the $15,000 HELOC is because you want to be sure you have the $5000 available in case of an emergency. Chances are pretty good that between your mortgage and your HELOC that nobody will issue you anymore credit so that $5000 is there to take care of any unforeseen event. Now on to why this BOOK's THEORY is NOT necessarily all that great. If you were to simply pay the $1666.66 extra every month rather than doing the HELOC method you would only take 2 months longer than doing it with the HELOC. The interest rate is nor the amount of the mortgage makes a difference. The only difference is in the amount you will save since the extra two months will be 2 times the monthly payment more that you've paid plus a little interest. Now if you have a large mortgage then your payments are big and that times 2 equals substantial money. If your mortgage is small (like $200K or $300K) then it's really not even worth the hassle to set up the HELOC. THE DANGER OF THE HELOC is something that people without discipline should not undertake and that is the availability to more money (more debt.) If you can't resist the temptation to spend then stay away from a HELOC period because if you can't pay the bank will take away your home. YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO LOSE YOUR HOME !!!! TRUST ME, BEEN THERE DONE THAT ! Last but not least....IT IS incredible how much you will save on a 30 year mortgage. Always remember that if you pay for the full 30 years you will pay nearly three times the amount of your mortgage over that 30 years. So if your mortgage is $200K then you will have paid about $600K at the end of 30 years. Saving over half that amount is much better. If you pay $275,000 then it only cost you $75,000 for the ability to make payments. Much better than paying nearly $400K for the priviledge of making payments. Who can't use an extra $325,000 ????? The bigger the mortgage the bigger the savings !",book

The book also opened my eyes to the advantages (think peace of mind) of having a strong equity base rather than being leveraged to the hilt and constantly panicked about my debt load. The book is clear, inspiring and a quick read. Above all it is informative. I feel I can now tackle my home loan and pay it off on my terms rather than the bank's. Boy does that feel empowering!

We are so happy we decided to read and try the system described in this book. The amazing thing is not that we will have our mortgage paid off in just 5 years, although thats pretty great, the best part is we are doing it without any change to our life style. We still take the same vacations and get out to play golf like we did before we read ""Own Your Home Years Sooner."" If you have heard, if it is too good to be true it isn't, then you have probably heard, every rule has an exception. This is the exception to the rule. Please don't listen to the nay sayers on the web. It really does work...our home will be paid off in the fall of 2014.Okay here comes the math teacher in me. You do need to have a 20% equity position in your house. For example, if your house is worth $100,000 you should owe $80,000 or less...if it's worth $200,000 you should owe $160,000 or less. If you have a 20% equity in your home you qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) which is necessary for this program. Let me stop right here and say that if you are the type of person who can not be disciplined about their spending habits this program is not for you. Please stop reading and forget you ever heard about it. Here's why. We qualified for a $75,000 HELOC. That money is for the program and not to be spent on ""stuff"". If you can do that then get the book. If you can't please walk away now.Our son and his wife are language arts teachers. They do not qualify for a HELOC because they don't have 20% equity in their home. When they were visiting we sat down and crunched their numbers and found out they could pay their home off in 7 1/2 years. We found out that the program would work for them but they can't start it until they can qualify for a HELOC. I went to the website referred to in the book and found another program that this author has written. It's a debt elimination program that is for people who do not qualify for a HELOC...yet. I purchased the program for the two of them which they will be starting soon. Since they haven't started the program yet I don't feel I can comment on it.

Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them.",book

If you have read another MIDI book better than this, I most likely have read it and disagree with you!

1470,"This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC.

MIDI is truly a beast worth utilizing, and works quite well, for some. But I wouldn't trust it with my life. All of these MIDI books give the history and theory of MIDI.

1488,"Basque Americans are one of the least known ethnic groups in the United States despite a long residence in the western part of the country. _Mother's Table, Father's Chair_ is one of the first studies to discuss Basque American women and their cultural roles within the American Basque culture. Basque sheepherders and others found ethnic communion and support in Basque boarding houses and hotels that were usually run by women. These Basque men who stayed in America often brought over their families, or married women from the old country who then migrated. Many Basque women migrated on their own. As new generations of native Basque Americans were born, women often became the principle carriers and preservers of cultural traditions, as well as primary agents of Americanization, as they sought and encouraged their children to seek the educational and material benefits of the United States. Jacqueline Thursby interviewed Basque American women across the West, observed and participated in cultural activities and events, and did supplemental research in the Basque country of Spain and France in preparation for this seminal overview of the culture of Basque American woemn. Thursby admirably clarifies the role of women in the transformation of Basques into Basque Americans. _Mother's Table, Father's Chair_ will be of immense interest to students of ethnography, basque culture, women's studies, and Western American studies.",book
1489,"Prior to reading this book, I did not realize that Basques have been such an important ethnic group in America's West. Thursby's book provides a fine overview of Basque settlement in the United States, and she uses this historical context to provide understanding of important forms of folklore in present day Basque cultural expressions. The major portion of the book is an overview of genres and forms of folk culture from areas with large populations of Basques. She provides special attention to the importance of women's contributions to the preservation and adaptation of this ethnic group's folklore, and she concludes her study with a thought-provoking and well presented analysis of the group's traditional culture. Many of her insights are useful for comparing and contrasting Basque traditional culture with the folklore of other ethnic groups in other regions, and Thursby's writing style is accessible and interesting.",book
1490,"Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections.",book
1491,"Searching for a read-aloud book that you might share with your children, you would score a consensus winner with this compendium of rich, highly captivating tales. The two selections from Jack London, ""In Yeddo Bay"" and ""To Repel Boarders"" were springboards for our youngsters beyond this book and on to ""The Call of The Wild"" and ""White Fang."" Similarly, short fables from Louisa May Alcott and Lewis Carroll opened our ears to continue with more famous, longer works by those authors. Rudyard Kipling's ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"" and Mowgli's Brothers"", ""Tommy and the Meadowmice"" by Thornton W. Burgess, ""Juggerjook"" by L. Frank Baum, creater of Oz, and ""The Voyage of the Northern Light"" by John Townsend Trowbridge each held my kids' attention as we read them aloud at dinner or at bedtime. The inestimable Mark Twain weighs in with a novella ""Tom Sawyer Abroad"" that is a perfect followup to a summertime reading of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" There is plenty of selection here for everyone to be happy. Give your kids the gift of colorful, imaginative literature...then read it aloud with them.If Mr. Buckley's politics or his pomposity is a bother, worry not about it here...he pens a pithy pre-amble, and among the classics also includes a modern-day computer adventure entitled ""The Temptation of Wilfred Malachey."" Just plain fun!",book
1492,"This collection of 38 stories selected and compiled by Bill Buckley is drawn mostly from the old St. Nicholas Magazine for children. The stories are of varied length (less than 10 pp. to more than 50). Although the authors and stories are of excellent quality (Kipling, Baum, Twain, Burgess, London, etc.), I would have liked some more variety.",book
1493,"Jensen continues to survey and summarise research studies on the impact of music and applies his gift in making them accessible to educators. He points out the common fallacy of considering music as a &quot;right-brained&quot; activity. Music affects many different parts of the brain. Only timbre activated the right hemisphere. Music enhances cognition, emotional intelligence, boosts peformance, heightens motivation. Reading, perception, motor skills, hearing, behavior and muscle strength are all influenced by music. Music also affects the immune system, stress, relaxation, blood flow and memory systems. You get wider coverage than Ch. 17 of the author's &quot;Brained-based Learning&quot;. You get many different recommendations for choosing appropriate musical pieces. Overall, this is a valuable challenge and resource for educators. One regret is that, compared to the cheaper and most informative &quot;Owner's Manual for the Brain&quot; (P. J. Howard, 831pp.), I'm puzzled why this slim book should be so costly.",book
1494,"Jenson has updated much information in this quickly-read book. Anyone unfamiliar with his works will find this helpful; veterans of the topic will find new, useful &quot;ammunition.&quot; Especially refreshing is the unbiased approach to the Mozart effect studies; a convincing view to show administrators because of its balanced presentation.",book
1495,"Music with the Brain in Mind is a short book full of great information. Each idea is well documented with research. Many ideas are given for use of music and brain research at school, in the studio, and at home. This book makes me want to read more by Eric Jensen.",book
1496,This is an easily accessible book. It is written in a way that educates without being too academic. Along with scientific explanations of brain functions integrated with the effects of music are practical applications of various exercises. This book is a helpful addition to my professional library of early childhood education.,book

1499,"From having him grow up a Manhattan gangster to including false photos the author shows an astonishing lack of historical research, especially for a man who has supposedly ""spent more than thirty-five years studying the life and times of Billy the Kid."" Included is just about every myth ever made up about the Kid with a few new ones thrown in. His sources? Most of these stories don't list any which is funny considering how many professionals have written biographies on him without reporting these. The sources he does list seem pretty disreputable too. He blatantly dismisses the accounts of the people who knew him. There is one page where he lists five accounts of Billy as a boy told by people who knew him and dismisses them all as biased. Not one subject agrees with him except, apparently, the ones who were never interviewed and can't refute him.His evidence that Billy stayed in New York City until he was fourteen and even committed a crime there is based entirely on the ill-kept census records of the time. There were thousands of McCarty's throughout the country and proving one of them to be the Kid is by now impossible. (Astonishingly enough he uses that same argument to prove that it couldn't possibly be the right McCarty family listed in Indianapolis as is the accepted history) He even has to change his and his mother's name to make it better fit his theory having her die before the record has her show up in Silver City.Based upon this flimsy evidence he makes up a complete back-story. He even has him travel all the way back to New York from New Mexico simply so that he can tie him in with a murder there before rushing back to New Mexico again. Again it requires major stretching of the dates and a name change to attribute this to the Kid. If Billy had ever gone by the name of Michael, been 3-4 years older, worked as a tinsmith at any point, and never left New York City then this might seem a more plausible theory. All the newspaper article says is that Michael McCarty aged 20 killed a friend with a knife. No further proof that it is the same person as Billy is listed nor even exists. As he himself states, McCarty is not exactly an uncommon name.This whole book, while fascinating, seems more a work of fiction than of fact. I'd recommend it as that if it weren't so boring and confusingly written. No doubt to hide the lack of any real substance. A real shame.",book
1500,"This book is the most accurate that I have read concerning the earlier years of Billy, Starting with the arrival of his mother in New York City, fleeing the Irish Potato famine. I would recommend reading this important book along with the Billy book writen by Robert Utley, &quot;Billy the Kid, A Short and Violent Life.&quot;",book
1501,"A graceful and clear translation of the Holy Bible, the NRSV maintains fidelity to the original Greek and Hebrew texts while producing an edition equally at home when read from the lectern at church or on the couch at home. The translators have carefully reviewed words which refer to men only, and, when appropriate, translated them to include all the faithful. For example, when the Apostle Paul addresses the &quot;brothers&quot;, the NRSV substitutes &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; They never tamper with masculine references to God. It is their contention that this slight modification actually makes their translation more accurate. For example, when St. Paul says, &quot;Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant concerning the resurrection,&quot; this version reminds us that the sisters should also not be ignorant. The complete version with the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books contains the fullest collection of books received as sacred Scripture by any historical branch of the Christian Church. By including such difficult-to-find books as 3 Maccabees and Psalm 151, they have produced the only easily obtainable Bible for the whole Church.",book
1502,"I purchased ISBN:0195283600. This particular edition differs a bit from other reviews I've read--no portraits, etc.It's an Oxford, so if it were possible for me to have gotten an NRSV with the Apocrypha in genuine black leather from someone else, I'd have done it gladly. Oxford generally cuts corners in the Bible-making process.Because it will be a secondary Bible for me, I'm not terribly peeved about Jesus' words NOT being red, there being no concordance, and there being no dictionary of any kind. The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible.I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well.Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV!If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied.",book
1503,"It's hard to find superlatives enough to describe this edition. Everything about it is both useful and beautiful.A pocket Bible with the Apocrypha is rare enough to begin with, but--in addition to the usual Catholic Deuterocanonicals and Protestant Apocrypha--this little book manages to include everything in the Greek and Slavonic canons. It will fatten your pocket a little, but it's worth the extra bulk to have the extra books, especially if you're interested in the history of Christian thought.The binding makes pocket Bibles from American publishers look crude. The type, even in the footnotes, is remarkably legible. There are just enough helps in the back to be useful without bulking up the book unnecessarily.The Anglicized Edition is not substantially different from the American edition of the NRSV. If you're a pastor, lector, or writer who needs to use the NRSV in the exact form that's approved for the liturgy in your church, you might not want to rely on this edition. I don't think most other readers will notice the difference.",book
1504,I am very picky about the typography in my Bibles--and for its small size this beautiful little Bible is very easy to read. I have the Burgundy Leather Bound edition which is beautifully bound and finished. This is the aforementioned &quot;anglicised&quot; version--I do want to counter the review above by saying that I don't find the differences troublesome at all. There are very few discrepancies between this and my &quot;regular&quot; NRSV...,book

1507,"Okay, I've been crocheting most my life but haven't tried socks. This looked interesting and fun. It has proved a lesson in frustration. The beginning of the book with basic how tos (hold a needle; make a chain stitch etc...) gives the impression that the instructions will be geared for beginners too.Not so: Basic Sock (Gusset and Foot) ""Sc in next 5 sc, working along side of heel flap in ends of rows, work 9 sc evenly spaced [see Terms on page 1] to last row of flap; dec over next row and first st of instep [mark this st for gusset]; working along side of heel flap in ends of rows, work 9 sc evenly spaced along other side of heel flap, sc in next 5 sc of Row 10 of heel--etc, etc...""Ummmmm...In a book that was profusely illustrated with diagrams at the beginning the lack of at least one image to show the above steps was glaring...did they lift the other images from their previous manuals or what? I have torn out the stitches and reworked them at least ten times yet still have no idea if I'm following the directions.If you want to learn to crochet socks (even if you're a seasoned crocheter), do not buy this book.",book
1508,"I really love this book. One of the ladies in my old Knitting Circle picked it up for me when the Toes Up Sock pattern stopped making sense. (I'd been working on this sock for weeks too. Within a couple of days I had my very first ever sock created. A second sock soon followed. Oh.. they're not perfect, but I wear them all the time. There's something oddly fullfilling about wearing a pair of socks you made yourself.I taught one of my coworkers how to make socks out of this book. She'd never crocheted anything more complicated than a simple double crochet scarf, and she went on to make a pair for every member of her family as a holiday gift.The instructions are very well illustrated where needed, (such as the turning of the heel) and very clearly written. They're so simple that now I am able to make my own variations becuase I know when I get to certain points, (heels, toes) I can go right back to the basic sock and everything will come together just fine.I love this book.",book
1509,"The patterns are quite straightforward and easy to follow. I successfully made my first pair of socks using the pattern in the book. There are patterns for worsted weight and for sport weight yarns, with variations on the cuffs or details.",book
1510,"This was one of the very first things I crocheted. The gusset was a little confusing until I realized the gusset illustration was in the beginning of the booklet. My socks came out great and my mom is already asking for a second pair, so I'll probably try a different style.",book
1511,"I have been searching for sock patterns, and there are several nice patterns in this book. They are easy to understand, and the end product is quite nice. I will add that there is a lot of repetition, and basically only a few patterns with some variations on the cuffs. But it seems that most patterns for sock yarn involve knitting, and finding crochet patterns can be quite a challenge. This book certainly fills that void.",book

1513,"The patterns are cute and easy enough to make but they are better used as slipper socks than socks. Crochet is really too bulking and stiff for socks. And it just doesn't provide the stretch you need for socks. If you want socks you can wear with your shoes, stick to knitting.If you want to use them as slippers they are fine. Just add some puffy paint or caulk to the bottoms so they are not to slippery on hard floors.",book
1514,"My review may seem a bit rambling & repetitive but its an early morning for me while the kids are still sleeping. Just take in consideration, I encourage you to GET THIS BOOK! SPEND TIME with your kid{s} utilizing it before they become older and you missed out on all the fun you could of had with them. making those memories that last a lifetime of smiles. Now grab your coffee/tea for why I personally find this book to be of a dying breed. Much love to the Author & publishers for sharing the Kids guide to building forts &lt;3 .Despite what a reviewer has wrote about ""safety"" no where in this book does it say to hand it over to the kid and leave them to do it ALONE. This book is perfect for the adult to SHADOW but in no way means for them to let the kid hit the local junkyard after receiving their Tet shot....Yes, it's true if you live in the city or some close together suburban neighborhood, the kids may have a hard time finding the common resources for building these things BUT there is NO reason why as a PARENT/ADULT you can not get involved in the hunt. Instead of finding a way to entertain your kid without you ""having"" to be involved, man/woman up and play with your kids!! This book is full of great inspiration & motivation for kids & their parents to spend time together. If the kid has never experienced this way of play then surely you know not to hand them the wheel without some supervision. If you do not have tree branches, pruning's around in your yard then ask around the neighborhood when you see trees being cut.Ask Grandma/pa or other relatives & friends. Ask a local tree cutting service if you can have branches from trees they are cutting nearby {instead of these things being put through their chipper machine}.The writer encourages resourcefulness, imagination, problem solving & common sense. Kids learn through playing and this book will do just that. From figuring out on their own what can be used {this is where you the parent/adult can take the time to look the book over with them & discuss what they would like to build from the authors pages} all the way to how the items they found will fit/work out with what they envision. There are no measurements, per say, it's all about collecting the items needed and putting it all together which is powered within their minds by problem solving. Great pictures and illustrations for guidance but this is not a blueprint style of book. This style of learning is one of the most lacked & must have skills our children NEED to learn. Many thanks needs to go to the author for putting this book out there for encouraging kids to use skills much needed in their adult lives. Resourceful problem solving. The adult can shadow, being their mind of reason with suggestions and encouragement but do not become so deeply involved the kids are not the main players. Build your own fort! :)Although I did not buy this book {yet! & surely will as a permanent piece of the kids home library}, I picked a copy up at the public library for some winter dreaming by the fire with my kids. My son & I looked it over, searching for which one he would like to build in the Spring with his sisters. We discussed where they might find such items for the fort designs he liked. He was won over by the stick/tree branch debri square fort, using a wattle weave for the walls. Kids learn that weave in school with paper projects so he knew by relating to the school project, how to wattle the walls. In this day & age where kids are rarely with the power of resourceful imagination due to the whole ""sanitary & safety"" hype, I was frustrated by lack of variety in books that do encourage & SPARK a kid to use their brains for resourceful problem solving with outdoor fun. This book provides that spark PLUS is a great way to get adults OUT OF THE HOUSE and playing with their kids. As a kid my brothers & I were left to roam the woods and neighborhood without supervision {it was the 80's!}, unlike children now who are locked behind fences & indoors with factory made electronic devices sapping up their childhood. Get over what the neighbors will think about you collecting & having tree branches laying around in the yard or collecting them.The bonus to their fort building is now what to put inside of it! A table made from a log? Planting some Mint or penny-royal around the edges to help keep bugs at bay? How about coming up with a club sign or sewing up a Fort flag?! This book can be the beginning to many great fun filled days. A domino effect, bubbling up the sparkle of imagination and happy times.",book
1515,"Nice concept but after reading it, these were all forts we built as kids. Granted it's been awhile, I'd rather check a book like this out from the library as it was mostly a memory trigger. I'll keep the book for our two boys (1&3) but they'll out imagine it by age 6 I'm guessing.",book
1516,"I bought this book thinking how cool it would be for an 8-year-old nephew. But I am blown away by the number of ways a kid could get hurt or even killed by following the advice in this book. After a very brief and largely useless &quot;safety first&quot; warning, the author goes on to suggest such things as snow forts that use car hoods and other heavy objects as the roof -- with snow packed on top, no less. If the kid isn't crushed or suffocated in his nifty new fort, he probably will die of lock-jaw from the cut he gets on the rusty edge of the car hood -- or from the old windows that the author suggests are the perfect thing for lean-to forts. Does this guy live next to a junk yard? There are several cool ideas in the book, but none that a kid probably couldn't come up with on his own -- especially if mom and dad say, &quot;Yeah, go ahead. Anything and everything you can find to drag into the backyard is ok with us.&quot; Several of the tee-pee/wigwam forts are just fine if a kid is in the woods with lots of deadfall. Otherwise, the environment is going to take a hit -- as are the $180 trees that the neighbors just planted last spring. Which is nothing compared to the hospital bill you'll have for the 19 stitches required to close up the gash from the suggested use of a scythe or weed cutter to &quot;gather handfuls of grass or hay no shorter than 15 inches.&quot; Send 'em over to my yard; my lawn needs mowing. Seriously, folks. This book should be recalled.",book
1517,"I also read this book when it was first available last year as an e-book, and I definitely found it inspiring.

1518,"I just want to say thank you to those of you who have posted reviews on here. After reading them I feel ready to read this inspiring book. I have been overweight all my life, and battled with self esteem issues for the majority of my adolescence. I must say to the people who have self-esteem issues who are not overweight, or haven't had an eating disorder...even though you find it hard to find something that reaches out to you, there are some good books that deal strictly with self-esteem and confidence issues. You must look within yourself to find out what it truly is that upsets you about yourself...is it your body, or is it that you feel inadequate in another way? Perhaps when you do that, you will realize that you are not unhappy with your body, but rather with another aspect of your life/personality. For the women who have weight issues, feel unattractive--we have many issues facing us. We have been labeled for the majority of our lives, and our issues have always been hidden...trying to avoid attention and finally we have resources that can help us deal with the emotional damage our weight and self confidence issues have caused.I'm looking forward to reading this book. I hope that it can help me heal my emotional pain caused by weight, food, and feeling unattractive.",book
1519,"There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help.""

1520,"This is a passionate, in-your-face plea for exploring the difficult process of transformational mediation, truly digging into the roots, the skin, the pores of people's, group's and organization's conflicts (although Cloke denies being a wholehearted transformational mediation believer).Cloke is the highly respected author of numerous books on conflict resolution and the director of the Center for Dispute Resolution in Santa Monica, Calif. He has a very fine sense of the nature of conflict, in all its rough-and-tumble, down-and-dirty depth and breadth. Cloke deftly and deeply explores the psychological, emotional and spiritual nature of conflict within each of us - an important facet of mediation.But sometimes, in his very exploration of these matters, he overreaches in his hopes of what mediation can accomplish. Certainly, in the confines of community mediation, even generally with only few participants involved, there is just so much of transformational mediation, of this deep personal examination that one can accomplish in basically a two-hour time period, the general length of most community mediations, at least in most of the United States, I believe.I find Cloke veering toward encouraging counseling and psychotherapy as part of meditation. Mediators are rarely trained in these and other similar fields and should tread lightly when going beyond their skill level and the parameters of mediation itself. In other forms of more in-depth and complex mediation, these possibilities might be explored, but in community mediation, it hardly seems likely or even possible.Cloke does come up with some astute observations. He says to not be afraid of conflict, which obviously can become tense and heated. This is very important, especially in Minnesota (where I've been a community mediator for 19 years), where people are frequently afraid of confrontation, of raising of the voice, where, from my understanding, the introductory comments of Minneapolis Mediation Program mediators are suppose to include saying basically that the participants should not raise their voice and not get confrontational, something I have never been comfortable saying, and something I as a mediator rarely do indeed mention.He gives an outstanding list of questions mediators can use in exploring conflicts (pages 37-38), citing a specific case of bullying. Mediation absolutely benefits from deep and clear thinking, and this series of questions is an excellent example of how a mediator can explore participants' conflicts in a very thoughtful and crucial way. This is a very valuable exploration.Cloke does a very good job of telling and showing how to become a better, more insightful mediator, a more self-examined mediator and person.Sometimes, however, Cloke can have his head in the clouds in his hopes and dreams of what mediation can be. On page 47 he mentions ""...moving conflicts beyond settlement and resolution, beyond resolution to personal and organizational transformation, and beyond transformation to transcendence"" (page 47). Whew! Made me feel like I was at an EST seminar and what exactly was he smoking? But better to have a grand vision and greater reach than to have a small and puny mind. No one could accuse Ken Cloke of that.He spends pages trying to define ""spirit"" and gets nowhere. He is just too New Agey in this and some other regards.Still, there is much valuable and thought-provoking material in this first half of the book, entitled ""The Inner Frontiers.""The book's second half, ""The Outer Frontiers,"" is less successful, discussing the larger issues of overcoming fascism and racism, building community, the limits of law, transforming institutional systems, etc. His plea for an issues-based thought process is delightful, and when we can convince dictators and warring tribes about this the world will be a better place. But hey, put out the ideas. Dream. Here some readers will find Cloke a visionary, others a dreamer. I lean toward the latter but admire his reach. I feel Cloke has little here that can be of use to a mediator. But if schools, businesses, government bodies and so on can use this kind of thinking and make some inroads on change and growth, wonderful.He does make a bold plea for the value of mediating domestic abuse, something mediation, in my opinion, correctly has avoided. With all his arguments, he fails to make the most important one: the imbalance of power between the parties. An obvious omission.""Mediating Dangerously"" can be of significant benefit to both the beginner and experienced mediator, although the complexities Cloke often delves into are much more likely to be of value to an experienced mediator who can more relate to these situations from the very fact of having gone through them. Still, they can be a valuable learning experience for the new mediator.In spite of some flaws, ""Mediating Dangerously"" is a valuable resource.",book
1521,"This book connects conflict mediation with spiritual growth. I found it extremely insightful. Not always easy reading, it takes a bit of time to digest, but this man has a very deep knowledge of both conflicts and human consciousness. This book is a guideline to changing the way you behave when you have conflicts, or to help others that have conflicts. One of the best books I read in the past few years.",book

1523,"David Remnick's ""King of the World"" is one of my favorite books, and it encouraged me to take on this meaty Pulitzer Prize winner. Remnick was on the ground as The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief, and in this work he strings together all of his exhaustive reporting for a compelling account of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.If you're running a mock U.N. at your school, I'd rate ""Lenin's Tomb"" as mandatory reading.",book
1524,"Reading David Remnick's unmatched work, chronicalling the demise of the USSR, may well have been responsible for my decision to major in Soviet History. As a professional student of the Soviet Union, if I could recommend only one book on the USSR, of the dozens that I have now read, this would easily be me choice. It is as informative for the novice as it is challenging for the expert. If you have even the slightest interest in the demise of a world superpower and the twentieth century's most influential - and murderous - ideology, you simply must read this book.",book
1525,"Despite the book's Pulitzer Prize, I'm a little ambivalent about saying this in one of the best books I have read. For sure, some of the best parts are that Remnick seemingly has open access to all the major Soviet political players while he was there. And he doesn't even brag about it. The titans of Soviet politics seem to be open to all who want to speak with them, though Remnick's day job as the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post certainly helped...a large part of his life in Russia then that he totally did not to write about.It's fun to follow him track down figures and weasel his way to get access to whoever he wants to talk with. He clearly is excited to be there during the transition and is personally invested in the story, as he speaks Russian and both his parents and his parents-in-laws have Russian ancestry. On the other hand, the book is a rag tag, contemporaneous collection of personal reporting and interests, lacking to some degree the broad overview that only comes with the passage of time.Doubtlessly, you get the feeling of what it was like living in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years and the transition to Yeltsin and the end of the Communist Party....with the addition of having Remnick magically inserting himself in front of whoever he wants to talk with to fill you in on the inside story.Enjoy it.",book
1526,"A useful history of the last days of Soviet rule and the early days of democracy in Russia, told through the stories of several, mostly prominent individuals. It provides a nice portrait of what exists, but lacks deep analysis to answer the question of why.",book

By telling the stories of Russians from the down-and-out to those in the loop, Remnick gives one of the most detailed description of the fall of Communism possible.",book
1528,"Remnick writes eloquently and grippingly. He amazes the reader with one heartbreaking vignette after another. It seems amazing that, though while only spending a few years in Russia, he seemingly met everybody who was anybody and traveled to the remotest parts of the dying empire.Remnick does not try hard, unfortunately, to maintain objectivity. He deifies much of the intellectual dissident movement, even repeatedly callling Andrei Sakharov a &quot;saint.&quot; Remnick turns Gorbachev into nothing more than a well-meaning Pandora, responsible for and unable to control the breakup of the Soviet Union.Remnick does show what I believe to be responsible for the breakup of the USSR- namely the rot, corruption and inefficiency endemic in the Soviet system- but he seemingly relegates it to symptomatic and not primary status. The empire would have inevitably broken up with or without Perestroika and Glasnost. The book should rank, despite its flaws, among the best books of contemporary history ever written-doing for Russia what Democracy in America did for the US.",book
1529,"&quot;Lenin's Tomb&quot; is the best and most complete account available of the remarkable transformation of Soviet Russia. David Remnick is an insightful reporter and a tremendous writer who witnessed these events first hand. From Remnick's descriptions, you will know what it was like to be a Russian in the heady days that included Glastnost, the conservative backlash, the fateful coup and the final demise of Mikhail Gorbachev. Remnick brings the story to life in a way that does it justice. This is absolutely essential reading.",book
1530,"David Remnick reported on site for the WASHINGTON POST during the Soviet Union's last days. He interviewed many persons, from society's bottom to society's top, from homeless derelict to Mikhail Gorbachev. That and his readable prose help explain how he won the Pulitzer. Of course it also helped that he was against totalitarianism and for humanity.When I read history I prefer a firm grip on the date. Overall, this story does flow in chronological order from 1988 to 1992, or to 1994 if you get the most recent edition with its afterword. But the story jumps backward occasionally when Remnick tells the history of a character, and at other moments I was vague on the date. I think chapters should have been subheaded with dates, and more spots within chapters should have stated the date.Nevertheless, do not let my preceding quibble deter you. I think this book is already something of a classic, and I'll be darned if I'm going to give it anything less than five stars. Does another book do as well as what this book does, which is put you into the scene of the collapse of the vast Soviet empire?I would have advised Mr. Remnick to include a double-paged map of the U.S.S.R. and a glossary of names, events, and institutions. We do get source notes, bibliography, index, a list of interviews, and twenty-two pages of relevant photos.The Vintage trade-paperback edition is over five hundred pages in small font. So be ready for something to settle back with. It will be worth a portion of the limited time you have in life. The story and the people are phenomenal, and they will expand your existential horizon.",book
1531,"A stupendous chronicling of history in the making! We are presented with several differing viewpoints on the collapse of the Soviet regime and its splintering, in these truly tumultuous years. As the author points out, whereas other empires, like England, took decades to recede and change - this took place within a few years. Within days sometimes, overwhelming transitions took place.The efficacy of this book is the internal focus on the people in the country itself; there is none of this hyperbole on how Ronald Reagan solely dismantled the evil empire! The book is about the Soviet Union - there is little on the break-away of the Eastern Bloc countries like Poland or East Germany. Mr. Remnick presents us with a wide array of people across this vast land - from various dissidents to various neo-Stalinists. We experience their anguish as the grim and brutal history of their country becomes revealed as once secret archives are exposed.This book is well-written, engaging and sprinkled with some wry humour. If you are interested in this epoch it is a truly marvellous and first-hand account.",book
1532,Both Remnick's on Russia provide deep and useful insights on the political life of this country. A must-read for people interested in Russia's recent history.,book
1533,"This book is one of those books that captured your attention from the beginning to the end. What differentiates this book from other books about Russia is the author's ability to convey to us the mood, the essence of a country that was in the brink of collapse &amp; to be revived as a brand new country. It is also one of those books that is difficult to be summarised in a few words but rather, it has to be read to be appreciated. This work depicts Russia as a country with turbulent &amp; troubled histories, occupied by citizens, some who were proud of its past glories (particularly its victory over the Facism in the war with Germany during World War 2, its Great Empire's status and a superforce to be reckoned with in the past) &amp; would shed their bloods for the glory of their nation, some who opted for the stability of the past when Communism seemed to promise that everybody is going to be looked after, some who are anxious to be caught on with the rest of the world. For an ex-Communist country that tried to catch up with the West, shamelessly influenced by capitalism for as long as we can remember, it has to overcome its steep learning curve. Growing pains such as emergence of mafias instead of enterpreneurs surfaced, corruptions, civil wars, &amp; so forth. A few chapters in the book are highly interesting such as the rise &amp; fall of Gorbachev (clearing the myths about him, &amp; conveying him as what a politician should be), the emergence of Yeltsin &amp; despite their differences, both of them deservedly win their places in history. Moreover, there are also chapters about common people who are living in God forsaken places with no basic necessities such as clean air, indoor plumbing, heating system that actually works, intellectuals who wanted to bring out the correct version of Russia's history so that they could learn from the past &amp; evolve from there to better beings but alas, it wasn't meant to be, writers like Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn who dared to write of the truths for the love of their nation with total disregard of their own safety, people who were killed in the millions during Stalin's reign &amp; Stalin as a person, Khruschev, Brezhnev, coup-de-etat that was supposed to clean up the mess that Gorbachev had created but subsequently, it was deemed as a farce in its own right, &amp; so forth. A substantial book that enlightens me about the plight of Russia &amp; a book that is definitely worth reading in this lifetime. Highly recommended.",book
1534,"David Remnick's ""Lenin's Tomb"" is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview, Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or ""Gorbachev"" in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders, journalists, KGB officers, bureaucrats, dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information, the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times, but there is very little information on the general state of the country, economic and social causes for the collapse, and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist, describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years, but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally, Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West, but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong, even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick: he is never mentioned without describing his ""saintliness"", ""superior morality"", and so on. Now in many of the cases Remnick's qualifications of his interviewees seem deserved, but it does get annoying after a while. Better to let readers decide whom they like than to pre-ordain all this.Overall, the book is mostly useful as a collection of interviews of important people at the end of the 1980s, and as such it is very balanced in the kind of people interviewed. It fails entirely as anything more though, and should not be used as a serious explanatory book on the hows and whys of the USSR's collapse. And that is somewhat disappointing.",book
1535,Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again.,book
1536,"this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word &quot;ramify&quot;? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file.",book
1537,"The book is a compilation of short stories (each chapter a dozen pages or so) about the author's first-hand experiences in the Gorbachev's Soviet Union. From Baltic to Sakhalin and from coal miners to Gorbachev himself, from Stalin to Yeltsin and from Solzhenitsyn to Sakharov, the book paints the picture of the monolith's fall. This colorful collage describing the critical period in Russian history, combined with keen commentary, creates for the reader the distinct flavor of the time.For Russia, it was the age of confusion and disillusionment. Gorbachev's half-hearted reforms (the interest in truth ended where the Party interests were concerned, the pursuit of democracy gave way to the pursuit of the runaway republics etc.) were matched by the half-hearted '91 coup (no real plan, no propaganda with the military, Lenin wouldn't have approved).For generations, Russian people did not know much of the sad history of their country and less still about the life in the West. The blissful ignorance was one thing that helped them in their miserable existence. Their various degrees of belief in the grand ideals were the other. With glasnost, Gorbachev aimed at opening the gates of truth while preserving the faith. In all honesty, it was impossible: the foundation for the faith was thoroughly rotten and relaxing the state control of mass media could only reveal it. All of a sudden, millions of people had to face hard evidence showing that the glorious history of their country never was. That the Bolshevik revolution was but a ruthless coup followed by a bloody terror. That many national heroes, all the way to Lenin, were privilege- and power-hungry maniacs. The Russian people had to go (and are still going) through an incredible adjustment of their understanding of right and wrong, brought about by a mere possibility of truth in the phrase of Molotov (himself not the most impeccable politician): &quot;Compared to Lenin Stalin was a mere lamb&quot;. Similarly, it was a hard realization for many a soviet man that in the late 80's &quot;an average Soviet had to work 10 times longer than the average American to buy a pound of meat&quot;. The full awareness of their tragic history and miserable reality must make it so much more difficult for Russian people to live in the country which is overwhelmingly corrupt, lawless and poor.Remnick's parents and in-laws, all four having escaped from the old empire, could not imagine going back even for a visit, apparently having no faith in the Russian democratic changeover. On the other side of the ocean, the Russian military colonel excavating the Katyn massacre site, by disobeying direct orders from a KGB general to stop the work, believed in the prevalence of positive change in Russia. Today's Russia, with its authoritarian government and shady political and legal process, still leaves its democratic future a matter of faith.By way of some criticism, Gorbachev brought about an incredible change. His glasnost and personal presence revived the anemic (or galvanized the non-existent) political forces unheard of in a largely Brezhnev-era Russia. He fought many of the first battles alone. The book does not make a case for that. Glasnost provided food for the hungry Soviet mind, but perestroika, restructuring, was supposed to change the way Soviet people live. The book could have benefited from taking on perestroika in some detail.Overall, very enjoyable and engaging.",book
1538,"Remnick's prose makes this history/political science book both readable and entertaining. Arguing that the country's downfall was due to the Soviet leaderships' ongoing assault against its country's collective historical memory and it's feeble attempts to give the country just enough perestroika and glastnost to keep it at bay are chronicled in a series of chapters or themes. Ironically, the limited attempts by Gorbachev to instill some democratic themes was just enough to whet the populace's appetite for more and set the country on a road it could not turn back from. Interestingly, Remnick argues that Gorbachev was at heart, a true communist who only wanted to make adjustments, not change the whole system. One gleans from this whole book that in a modern world, democratization of the body politic is inevitable, once its processes are set in motion. Though the author focuses very little on outside influences contributing to the USS's demise, i.e. the cold war or &quot;evil empire&quot; policies of the U.S. he has written the most compelling account of the country's downfall as orchestrated from within its borders and i nthe process graphically illustrated the moral degradation and vacousness of communisim, its practitioners, and the suffering endured by its people. The Soviet Union was essentially a Third World Country with a first world military, over 80% of the population lived in squalor equal to most thirld world citizens. A stupendous book!",book
1539,"It's hard to imagine there was any dissention from the Pulitzer committee over ""Lenin's Tomb"". This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine, precise, descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such ""good for you"" books are long slogs about as exciting as bran, ""Lenin's Tomb"" was a surprising pleasure.I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general, let alone the Soviet transition, and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. ""Lenin's Tomb"" manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening, Remnick provides, no more and no less.""Lenin's Tomb"" proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience, but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China, only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also, while ""Lenin's Tomb"" did not make me like Russia or Russians any more, it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way, so that I now hold it against them less.""Lenin's Tomb"" is almost novelesque in its readability, a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving, compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize, but from a journalistic perspective, ""Lenin's Tomb"" is the book all of us wish we could write.",book
1540,"Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid ""history books"" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved.",book
1541,"David Remnick in ""Lenin's Tomb"" writes a fascinating book on the demise of the Soviet Union. Remnick manages to convey the views of the liberals who want to democratize the country and the neo-Stalinist conservatives who want to turn the clock back to the repression of life under Stalin.The author has little sympathy for Mikhail Gorbachev who once he launched ""perestroika"" could not make the final commitment to democracy and republicanism and remained trapped in the dying and corrupt Communist Party. Yet, Gorbachev's half-hearted attempts at reform nearly ended in a disasterous rigt-wing coup. Only, the incompetence of the plotters and will of the people not to turn back to a corrupt failed system prevented the USSR in falling back into despotism.Because of ""glasnost and perestroika"" Remnick was able to obtain candid views from everyone he interviewed during his stay in the Soviet Union. Miners, dissident and even communist party apparatchiks spoke freely about the good and bad of Russia. Nearly, 50 years after his death, Stalin's shadow still hovered over everything and everyone in the nation. Liberals such as Andrei Sakharov wanted the government and the party to fully acknowledge the heinous attrocities of mass murder and imprisonments committed during Stalin's reign, Khrukhschev made a tentative start at 20th party congress in denouncing Stalin but failed to follow through with real reform. During the Brezhnev years the country lurched backwards thast by the time Gorbachev came to power the Soviet Union was totally morally, politically and economically bankrupt.Remnick also does a fine job showing the first hesitant steps toward capitalism yet evenn today 10 years after the Soviet Union collapsed Russia still refuses to make the fundamental changes to bring a market economy fully to fruition. Under the Communists there was ""equity in poverty"" today in Russia you see the extremes of rich and poor. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the demise of the Soviet Union, but it needs an update to encompass the last decade.",book
1542,"Now that we are a decade removed from the fall of the Soviet Empire, it is a wonderful to look back and read a fabulous primary source about the events. Remnick, the Moscow correspondant for The Washington Post, during the late 80's and early 90's (and since the editor of the New Yorker, which was a well deserved honor for a fabulous journalist, if I may say so myself) was right on the scene when the incredible collapse of Communism took place. He interviewed hundreds, if not thousands, of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role, regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant, in the transformation of the nation, and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written, and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so), likes history in general, or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you.",book
1543,"After seventy-four years, the Soviet Union, a decrepit gerontocrat like its former pilots, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, shuffled off its mortal coil. Journalist David Remnick, who spent four years in Moscow, compiled a series of thematic events into Lenin's Tomb, and explained how glasnost, initiated in small doses by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, became GLASNOST that proved too potent for the dilapidated Soviet state, and in the end, the Marxist-Leninist foundation on which the State had been build. An overdose of GLASNOST gave the Soviet Union a fatal political cardiac arrest.However, in his indicting assessment, he notes how the Party and the Soviet Union, like Lenin's mummified husk, was politically, spiritually, and economically bankrupt. ""The Soviet Union was an old tyrant slouched in the corner with cataracts and gallstones, his muscles gone slack. He wore plastic shoes and a shiny suit that stank of sweat. He hogged all the food and fouled his pants. Mornings, his tongue was coated with the ash-taste of age. ... The state was senile but still dangerous enough."" Nice analogy, huh?Remnick further identifies the cause of that decay with the Party and its failure to keep the promises of socialism to the ordinary Soviets: ""The men of the Communist Party, the leaders of the KGB and the military and the millions of provincial functionaries who had grown up on a falsified history, could not bear the truth. Not because they didn't believe it. They knew the facts of the past better than anyone else. But the truth challenged their existence, their comfort and privileges. Their right to a decent office, a cut of meat, the month of vacation in the Crimea--it all depended on a colossal social deception, on the forced ignorance of 280 million people. ... When history was no longer and instrument of the Party, the Party was doomed to failure. For history proved precisely that: that the Party was rotten to the core."" And once ordinary Soviets realized they had been lied to, that the socialist utopia was a pipe dream, they wanted the riches and luxuries that only a capitalist system could provide. In short, the Party was over.Gorbachev was willing to give the Soviet people an inch, i.e. glasnost. As the caretaker of History, he was willing to demonize Stalin but not Lenin. Denouncing Lenin would mean denouncing Marx and Communism, and flat out telling the Soviet people that they had lived a lie for seventy-four years. Instead, the Soviet people took their miles, GLASNOST, and ran with it to many finish line; for the Russians, it would be the demonstration in front of the parliament building on 20-21 August 1991.Glasnost had thus led to GLASNOST. The influx of information and culture from the West, formerly forbidden books, had led to the ghosts of the past rising up again, be they formerly independent republics absorbed by Russia, or institutions that had been partially banned, such as the church.Glasnost also revealed the failings of the system, and this was most painfully apparent with the Chernobyl tragedy 26 April 1986. Chernobyl was the epitomy of many things. One, it symbolized ""every curse of the Soviet system, the decay and arrogance, the willful ignorance and self-deception."" Two, ""Chernobyl was not like the Communist system. They were one in the same. ... The system ate into our bones the same way the radiation did, and the powers that be--or the powers that were--did everything they could to cover it all up, to wish it all away""According to Remnick, Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika as a bandage, albeit a piffling one, to the Soviet Union, and he should be credited for that courageous act in face of the opposition he faced. However, he was outshadowed by Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin, who advocated what the people really wanted, GLASNOST and PERESTROIKA, i.e. open heart surgery. They and the Soviet peoples took GLASNOST to its logical conclusion, chucking the Soviet Union's bones into the dustbins of History.This is a well-detailed critical book that explores the whys and hows of the Soviet Union's collapse, and more interesting for those like me who witnessed the Gorbachev era.",book
1544,I bought this when it was originally published but it got lost in the shuffle of other quotidian matters. Picked it up last week and couldn't put it down.

Still works after all these years..............Five stars is not high enough.,book

It is smooth flowing, vivid in its descriptions and captured the mood at the time in such an authentic way. The reliance on interviews gives a lot of credibility to the narration and the portrayal of the character in the the situations they found themselves in. The society as a whole is bared for he reader to understand and the system's shortcomings are exposed.

1549,"Here in Brazil, I read this good book. This book has great things:1- This book shows how Lenin was even more violent than Stalin. As an example of this fact, on page 45 there's a sentence from Molotov: ""Compared to Lenin, Stalin was a lamb"".2- Modern Anti-Semithism in Russia has correct cover in this book.3- Gulag's times and purges are well covered in this book. This book clearly shows that Lenin and Trotsky invented the concentration camps on page 300.4- Person being Stalinists in 1980 and 1990 decades are remembered in this book.5- Gorbachev's failures and qualities are well covered in this book.6- Terrible standard of living in former Sovie Union is well covered in this book. They lived worse than some Afrikan countries.7- The links of Russian orthodox and politics are well covered in this book. See page 427, as an example.8- The doomed communist coup of 1991 is well covered.Some problems in this book:1- This book uses the word Right and reactionaries instead of Left and Marxists.2- About the Soviet economic collapse between 1989 and 1991, there's informations, but not enough.",book

You had the feeling you could run into history on the way to the bank or the seashore.&quot; Lucky for us, Remnick spent 1989 (as well as the years before and after) in Moscow.",book
1552,"Wow. I wanted to buy a noteworthy book that was definitive re: old USSR. I looked to award winning books on the subject and then, as always, checked with Amazonian's ratings. Before I started the book I assumed I would read some, scan some and re-educate myself on the subject. It was GREAT READING. A book that describes despair, fear and degradation of an entire nation of people. One asks onself, again and again throughout history, what conditions of the mind must exist that have throughout time enabled those in power to justify the destruction of the human spirit. Of course that begs the question as to how those STAY in power for decades on end. Author Remnick writes wonderfully and easily of tough experiences and yet they are not so horrific when laid on the page by this author, rather this book does read like a novel and thus it is easlily digested and hard to stop reading. Fascinating stuff which includes how the book itself was researched and written. Read this book, you won't be sorry. I would love to find another non-fictional account on any subject matter that rivals this. I'd love to know if there are any good suggestions.",book
1553,This book is flat awesome. I read it three times. It stands as a classic. I hope it never goes out of print. Anyone... I mean ANYONE... who is interested in the fall of the Soviet Union... this is required reading. This book absolutely deserved the Pulitzer. Very very well done.,book
1554,"Just a quick note, I really enjoyed this book. I was an adult when the Soviet Union fell, but I was very ignorant of what was really going on. Remnick's incisive portraits of the people on both sides of the fall of Communism bring the era to life.",book
1555,"The ironically titled Lenin's Tomb is a stunning piece of reportage about the circumstances leading up to the destruction of the Soviet Union. It was written by a reporter who was in the middle of the crisis as it reached its apex, and has a lived-in immediacy to it that sets it apart from other researched works on the topic. It succeeds on numerous levels, as journalism, as accessible history lesson, as a devastating portrait of a massive and failing country, as a treatise on 1980's European politics, and as an honest character study on the big names in Soviet government, their desires and intentions, and how those were never humanely transposed to the public which led to massive protest and a stunning moment in world history. Remnick tells the story circuitously, devoting whole chapters to different injustices or portraits of Communism's failures throughout the country, be it in starvation in a collectivized farm, corruption with the KGB in Lubyanka, or miserable working conditions in a coal mine in the Urals. These pieces of governmental incompetence grow and grow, culminating in murder, Chernobyl, apathy mixed with anger, and a renunciation of perestroika and Gorbachev within the Politburo. It is an incredibly complex story beautifully told by a brilliant reporter who knows the topic inside and out. Attention to detail is great here as well; Moscow, a far away city going through unbelievable upheaval, comes alive here. My only complaint is that the book got a little dry in the end, but for what you learn up to that point it is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject.",book
1556,"Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch, which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup', KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents, I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President, who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service, at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6, and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets, which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria, I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff, and his book does so nicely.",book
1557,"A great fresco of the dramatic death of the communist URSS. The author lived as a correspondant in moscow for many years during the final years of the cold war and describes the tragic living conditions of the common people, the corrupt style of living of the burocrats, the disgusting privileges of the elites. An enclosed empire founded on corruption, lies, violence and misery where the dream of a better life for the masses promised by the communist leaders in the decades only became a rotten shell of deception and misery. The author interviewed hundreds of people of any social class, from the miners in the urals to Mr. Gorbachev, from Yeltsin to the moscow houseviwes, including scientists, artists, poets, smart people confined to the edges of the empire because of their open mindedness and acumen. This book is another important tragic witness of a wrecked dream, a tale told by hundreds of different voices that all tell thesame story of treachery and indecency, corruption and stupidity. A great history book that I highly recommend and that clearly helps us to understand why now Urss is governed like an authocracy by an ex kgb officer. Great book.",book
1558,"This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. It maps the mindset and events during this dramatic change. It is told with a direct, personal style that I found gripping, and that gives a very good sense of the societal changes and impacts. I highly recommend it.",book
1559,"David Remnick writes in his book, ""Once the regime eased up enough to permit a full-scale examination of the Soviet past, radical change was inevitable. Once the System showed itself for what it was and had been, it was doomed.""Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost reforms opened Pandora's Box of freedom. Once the people experiences freedoms, they wanted more. Without a tyrant in control anymore, like Gorbachev's predecessors, nothing could hold the Soviet Empire together anymore.I highly recommend this book. I also recommend ""The Cold War: A New History"" by John Lewis Gaddis,"" ""Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended"" by Jack Matlock (Reagan's top advisor and ambassador to USSR), ""America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945-2002"" by Walter LaFeber and ""The Cold War: The United States and the Soviet Union, 1917-1991"" by Ronald Powaski. Also read Ronald Reagan's autobiography ""An American Life."" Reagan himself debunks the false claim that he destroyed the USSR. In fact, he and Gorbachev became friends and peacefully ended the cold war a few years before Gorbachev fell from power.

1560,"Back before all news came filtered through a television lens, hard working men and women travelled to remote locations and put themselves in harm's way to write eyewitness accounts of history for newspaper and magazine readers. This fascinating book is full of such accounts, from William Shirer's account of the 1938 Munich Conference (including his brush with a swaggering Hitler) to fascinating reports of the fall of Paris by A. J. Liebling and Virginia Cowles, to Edward R. Murrow's descriptions of war-torn but defiant London to Ernie Pyle's moving tales of soldiers in the trenches of Africa and Sicily. This book offers a unique glimpse into World War II by the people who were there, who lived through the extraordinary as well as the ordinary moments of that war. Included in this volume are incredible snapshots of the American homefront, including a report from a Japanese internment camps, as well as a &quot;report on mass murder&quot; in German concerntration camps by Ed Murrow in 1942, long before most Americans had any idea of the true horror of the holocaust. This volume explores all aspects of the war, and, as such, is an incredible historical document as well as a fascinating read. Highly recommended!",book
1561,"I am so glad the Library of America put together these volumes of reporting from the Second World War. Sadly, all those who were living during those years are leaving us all to rapidly. Certainly, the living knowledge of the events and times is fading fast. While we value the books great authors give us, we should treasure even more the writing given us at the time. In volume one we have reporting from great journalists starting in 1938 Shirer's article on the Munich conference that gave Germany the Sudetenland.We get to follow the rise of Anti-Semitism in Germany with Kristallnacht, the fall of Poland and Paris. The London Blitz is covered by Edward R. Murrow and more and more. The United States doe not even enter the war until page 241 with the Herald Tribune's reporting of Roosevelt's ""War Message"".The reporting also takes us into the Pacific and gets us down with those doing the actual work of the war including Annalee Jacoby's account of nurses under fire in Bataan. We get early reporting on the Japanese Internment camps and the Holocaust with the NY Times reporting in 1942 that one million Jews reported slain.There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view. This first volume ends with the Mountain Campaign in Italy in 1944. The volume also supplies a short, but full chronology of the war, some excellent maps, biographies of the journalists, acknowledgements, notes on the texts, and a glossary of military terms.A superb job.",book
1562,"You can read history books and watch all of the redigitalized DVD's (movies) of World War II stories but the ""best of the best"" is right here in this wonderful compilation of first hand accounts from reporters who were on the scene and reported back to their readership when the events were actually occurring. It is fascinating to read what was reported at that time in history. This compliation is well worth reading. It also contains a great general biographical summary of all of the reporters who's work appears in the book. These were interesting people in their own right. I will use their biographies as a valuable resource for other additional readings.",book
1563,"If any book deserves more than a five star rating this (as well as its sequel, ""Reporting World War II Part Two: American Journalism 1944-1946"") is it. Attractively bound, compact and very readable, this volume is Part One of a two-volume set which provides an incomparable overview of World War II, as it was experienced by our parents' and grandparents' generation.This is not just another book about The War and the Big Names who create and control Events. It is above all a book about ordinary people and for ordinary people, who find themselves caught up in positions not of their choosing. Some are victims, some are heroes, some just watch and wait, but most are small pieces in a Big Picture they can barely comprehend.Unlike the usual histories of World War II, which have been written long after the fact and with the benefit of hind-sight, this superb collection, arranged in chronological order and using newspapers, magazine articles, radio broadcasts, diaries and photographs from the great journalists of the day, allows us to follow the events - at home and abroad -- as they happened. We all know how events turned out, but this book takes us back to that time, with an immediacy, an uncertainty and an irony, to what it was like to be alive during this immense, all-consuming, mid-20th century, global conflict.Beginning with William Shirer at the Munich Conference of 1938 which handed the Sudetenland over to Hitler, then in Berlin on September 1, 1939 reporting on the German Invasion of Poland, and later, at Compiegne for the surrender of France in 1940, these are some of the high-lights:Sigrid Schultz in Berlin on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938;A J Leibling in Paris and Virginia Cowles fleeing Paris before the German advance;Edward R Murrow broadcasting daily from London during the Blitz;C L Sulzberger from Athens (also soon to fall) on the German invasion of Yugoslavia, April 1941; andMargaret Bourke-White on the Russian Front in 1941;The New York Herald Tribune prints Roosevelt's war message on December 8, 1941 as ""America declares War"";Husband and wife team -- Melville Jacoby describes the Japanese attack on the Philippines, December 1941, ""War Hits Manila"", and Annalee Jacoby records the heroism of ""Bataan Nurses"" under fire;Raymond Clapper provides a ""Pearl Harbor Post-mortem"";Ernie Pyle is on the spot in London, North Africa, Sicily & the Italian campaign;On Christmas Night 1941 Cecil Brown sends a cable from Singapore on the ""Malay Jungle War"";Jack Belden describes ""Stilwell's Retreat Through Burma"", May 1942;Brendan Gill is on the US Home Front in 1942, ""Rationing"";""A Vast Slaughterhouse"", a report of the extermination of Jews, appears in the New York Times, June 1942 - a harbinger of the horrors to come;E B White follows Dorothy Lamour to Bangor, Maine for a ""Bond Rally"";Roi Ottley, George Schuyler & Deton Brooks report separate incidents of racial discrimination including the murder of black soldiers in the US;John Hersey is at Guadalcanal, October 1942;John Steinbeck joins a troop ship to Salerno, September 1943;Edward Kennedy reports on the infamous ""Patton Slapping Case"", November 1943;Martha Gelhorn visits the RAF Burn Centre, 1943 in ""the Price of Fire"";War correspondent Richard Tregaskis with the troops in Italy reports on himself getting shot; andGertrude Stein writing from Occupied France in 1944 is ""Tired of Winter Tired of War.""This volume concludes in the spring of 1944 as the tide is turning in Allied favour.I highly recommend this book and its sequel. Most of the articles are less than six pages in length, which makes them ideal reading for those time-wasting intervals of life - check-out lines, doctor's offices and waiting for buses. I guarantee the time will whiz right by!",book
1564,"There is little I can add to the fine reviews already posted on this site. Library of America has done a fine job collecting these works, and adding useful sections on maps, notes, author mini bios and an excellent yet brief Chronology of the main events of WWII.Some of these articles verge on literature. Consider the following opening sentences of an article written by Mary Heaton Vorse on munition girl workers (""The girls of Elkton, Maryland"", p. 471):""It was pay day at the munitions plant. There seemed to be a run on the bank at Elkton.""Or, how about Ernye Plye reporting the London bombing of December 29, 1940 (p. 147):""Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of one-third of the entire circle of London. As we stepped out onto the balcony, a vast inner excitement came over all of us --an excitement that had neither fear nor horror in it, because it was too full of awe. You have all seen big fires, but I doubt if you have ever seen the whole horizon of a city lined with great fires...""You can skip articles back and forth if you wish, or read cover to cover, depending on your personal taste.

1566,"I am so disappointed with the quality of this book that I am returning it. I actually paid more for this edition because the cover looks so nice that I thought it might even be a modern type-set edition. Instead, it's an extraordinarily bad copy of the original. The illustrations are grayed out, and the bottoms of many pages are simply unreadable -- most of the characters have disappeared from the middle of the bottom two lines. This is not really even a book. It looks like their laser printer ran of toner. Amazon should be ashamed of itself.The ""publisher"" says its reprint is of an older book and may contain errors, etc. I just purchased a Ruskin original printed in 1885 that resided in the Franklin Pierce College Library until 1985.

1567,"Another book on the great Nothingness and Oneness/God and Monism-and our realization of this and merging with it. The different methods this book used to capture the essence of Spirit were brilliant. Those would be: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology. He writes about those archetypal characters that are within your own self, and the dark shadows that you have by which casted a veil between you and the Beloved. That is what is also key to this work, it describes the true Love that is God and that I know is the essence of our full existence and the Ultimate Reality. It is the ocean that is God, and any love that we experience in this life is a glimpse of the ocean of love which is Oneness. And any beauty here on Earth is a reflection of the infinite ocean of beauty that is Oneness. Our goal is to reach that by transforming our inner shadows. Now you might wonder how that archetypal plane is related to reaching Oneness, and that is through the other side of this book: dreamwork. Usually in describing monism and reaching God through the higher levels of reality, dreams are thought of as lower levels than what we experience now. But this author interprets them in light of our Self, which is One with realization of God. I must say that while reading this I felt more deeply suspended into that mystic Oneness.",book
1568,"The author uses many threads (Jung, Blake, Edinger, Jacobi, Mother Teresa, Esther Harding, Rumi, St. John of the Cross, etc.) to weave a simple, refreshing, mystical work. The Sufi exposure is a welcome addition for the Western reader in the journey along the alchemical path. The way of unity for seekers presents a challenge to those consciously pursuing the spiritual life.",book
1569,"Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction.",book
1570,"Every once in a while, a book is published that siginificantly advances knowledge. Thus, it is with great pleasure that I state that Dr. Nemata Amelia Blyden's book is bound to be regarded as one of the greatest books on West Africa produced in this decade. This brilliant, synchronic, historical tour de force teaches us about the trans-oceanic migration of West Indians from the Caribbean to Sierra Leone in the decades after slavery was abolished in the British colonies in 1807. Employing both primary and secondary sources, Dr. Blyden in the eight chapters of this book chronicles how the West Indians who immigrated to Sierra Leone during this period came to occupy numerous positions in the colony and the colonial administration; how they became an important minority, albeit not always well-liked; and the impetus for their power and influence. More tantalizing is how Dr. Blyden skillfully weaves together the economic, political, psychological and social contexts of the time (1808-1880) to tell this fascinating history in an interpretive style. In essence, any student of history and the social sciences should get a copy of this book. It represents effulgent scholarship",book

From theories, ideals, principles, and facts he shows how Modern Witchcraft/Wicca came to be.He is a scholar and historian, rather than a Wiccan trying to prove the ""authentic ancient heritage"" of Wicca. He not only proves that Modern Witchcraft/Wicca is not ancient, he also proves that this lack of antiquity is completely irrelevent to the viability of Gardner's new religion.Anyone interested in Modern Witchcraft/Wicca or any form of neo-Paganism should read this book. He provides a list of sources and resources that an average person could barely make it through in a lifetime. Nearly anything you've ever seen in print regarding Modern Witchcraft/Wicca can be proven or disproven through the sources and resources he sites.

Of course, I don't agree with ALL of what he says here, but boy did he ever open a can of worms and make me think! I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?",book
1591,"Answer: What would you like it to be changed into?This is a sympathetic book towards neo-pagans. Ironically, because Hutton does not buy the party line of a pre-historic, nature religion whose tecahings have survived in an unbroken line through family clans, it's not popular with advocates of the matriarchal apostolic succession. In other words, pop Wicca 101 writers hate his guts.A Wicca, in case you haven't got a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary handy is a 'male witch' ( as contrasted with Wicce, a female )However if you've changed your name to Snowflake, Blackjack-for-my-Tribe, or some other Native American or Celtic ..., it's re-defined as someone who practises the 'Craft of the Wise', and to Hades with linguistic analysis. Who do these scholars think they are, anyway?Native American names are popular, since they had a splendid history of women's rights. Celtic ones are also cool, since the Druids were an all male priesthood who, like the Aztecs, practised human sacrifice , but c'mon, those redheaded Irish babes were hot!All Praise to Brigid!Wiccans or Witches are NOT--as they never tire of pointing out to the public--Satanists.Which of course makes absolutely no difference to the majority of Jews, Christians or Muslims, let alone fundamentalist ones; but I imagine it must be a source of great relief to Satanists, who consider Wiccans fluffy, neo-pagans, with atrocious taste in poetry. Hate to to say it, but they've got a point.""The Charge of the Goddess"", for example, is a watered down ... of Crowley's Egyptian hymn to Nuit. Hutton suggests Wiccans would be better of with the lunar poetry of Shelley, Keats, Graves and other romantics.I hope I'm not making it sound like Hutton is ridiculing anyone;s religion. He's not. He's an old school Brit and goes out of his way to be cordial. It's just that the man IS a historian, so faced with some of the more bizarre claims of 'Traditional Wiccans' his polite response may sound to some hard core believers as if he's punching out the Tooth Fairy in front of a kindergarten class.For example, take the question of how a pagan polytheistic religion, whether invented or re-discovered in England by the likes of Gardner, Sanders, Dion Fortune and company--who were politically somehere to the monarchical right of Attila The Hun, cross over to the USA and become an evangelical, feminist, ecolological and de facto monotheistic (THE Goddess )religion?It's a fascinating historical tour de force by Hutton, a mystery story that weaves the threads of archeology from Sir Arthur Evans in Crete to Mariaja Gimbutas in Anatolia; combining the longings of 19th century Romantic writers--Charlotte Bronte included--to the celebration of Yule and other worldwide nature rites, to the ""Burning Times""--a wildly revitionist view of the witch trials in medeival Europe--courtesy of Gardner, to the ancient worship of goddesses from Egpypt to Europe who were far more likely to be associated with motherhood, or war, than with rollicking about in the forest, invoking the moon.Perhaps the best defense for a belief in a worlwide Lady and Lord of the Woods pre-historical religion ( where did I put my VHS of 'The Wicker Man'?) comes from the craving of the soul. In a short story by Lovecraft, whose name I can't remember, a man brings an ancient vase to an archeologist who informs him that it's a fraud---no more than a hundred years old. The man counters by telling him that it's even more recent--he painted it himself last night, but the image came to him in a dream, and dreams are older than mankind. Hutton borders on the same point.As Robert Graves observed, though nominally The West is Christian, in actuality, most of us live as if we were ruled by what he called the 'unholy trimverate' of Pluto, god of wealth, Apollo, god of science and Mercury, god of thieves.May The Goddess protect you from having to sell used cars for a living. . .",book
1592,....if you are truely interested in witchcraft. It tears apart the myths of wicca. This book is not for those who want to bask in a romantic vision of coven witchcraft nor for those who would have it that solitairy witches are the true inheritors of age old pagan practices.What it does leave intact is a history about humans who tried to break free from religious and social doctrine. Humans that created an inspired practice of modern pagan philosophy and practice. It is also a study into the dynamics of religious emancipation with all it's - apparently unavoidable - hiccups.I loved this book. It's managed to combine a critical look at the faulty wiccan construction of it's own history with a respectful and sympathetic handling of wiccan spirituality.,book
1593,"The print in the paperback edition is agonizingly small. Try and find a hardcover copy if you like your eyesight. Maybe it's just me, but I've read a lot of books, and for this one I literally had to refocus my eyes to pick it up and put it down.",book
1594,"I have been a member of the pagan community for over 10 years, and I feel that Hutton has a better grasp of modern paganism than many neo-pagans and wiccans do! I wish pagan writers would do the kind of in-depth research that was done to produce this book.It is the first true history of Wicca that has ever been done...until now all we've gotten were the ridiculous myths and old sacred cows which should have been put down years ago. Here is our history told as it was, not as we might wish it to be, and I for one appreciate the factual account. Hutton is extremely sensitive and sympathetic (even supportive) of wicca as a valid relgion - and he is respectful to all of our founding fathers and mothers. He has obviously given great care to his research and respect to the pagans he contacted. I am astounded at how much he genuinely seems to like our religion and our people.Every pagan should own this book, and every trad leader and hp should have this on their required reading list.",book
1595,"I liked the book in many ways, but I was disappointed in his logic in the chapter about Ceremonial Magic and the Golden Dawn. One of the main thrusts of his book seemed to be that British Wicca was first deconstruction of the magic/religion dictotomy....and that this didn't happen with the Golden Dawn because it was a &quot;magical&quot; organization as opposed to a &quot;religious&quot; one. Albeit it was a different kind of magic...more theurgy as opposed to thamaturgy, but still not &quot;religious.&quot;I ended up more in conflict with Hutton on this, but I found the other aspects of the books more rewarding. The other part of Hutton I appreciated was his discussion of why research in this field is so difficult---that the closer you get to the present and away from Medieval and Renaissance magic and witchcraft, the tougher it is to function without access to private libraries.There are some practitioners who would disagree with his views on topics such has pagan notions of &quot;sacrifice&quot;- but the jury is still out on many of these issues, and there is still no clear consensus between practitioners and scholars on how to map many common religious notions, such as &quot;sacrifice&quot; onto Wicca.",book
1596,"Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written.",book
1597,"The world still awaits a truly comprehensive history of Neopaganism. Margo Adler's estimable DRAWING DOWN THE MOON is perhaps the closest approach to date. With THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON, British historian Ronald Hutton has raised the bar for future efforts both in terms of depth of research and genuine insight. Though his book focuses on the antecedents and development of British Wicca, it contains a wealth of material to any reader interested in Neopaganism.Hutton is something of a bte noire for many Wiccans and other Neopagans after his iconoclastic PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES, particularly for his corrosive attacks on Robert Graves and THE WHITE GODDESS (however deserved they may have been). Hutton's work is, nevertheless, grounded in substantial research (as befits a widely-published historian) and a generally non-judgmental tone. Hutton continues his no-stone-unturned approach in this new book, but departs from simple history to offer rationales for the viability of Neopaganism as a religious path, even given its apparent twentieth-century origins.For many Neopagans outside of traditionalist Wicca, the book's focus on Neopagan Witchcraft (and in particular on Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders) may render its iconoclasm old news. Hutton's research only buttresses the deconstruction of Wicca begun in the '70s. Hutton's gift, though, is to go beyond the first order deconstruction and find unexpected bits of information amidst an impressive array of personal papers and museum holdings. For example, most informed readers will already be aware that &quot;Old&quot; Dorothy Clutterbuck, Gardner's supposed initiatrix, was shown to be a real person, after years of argument to the contrary. Hutton demonstrates, however--and rather conclusively to my mind--that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; could not have been the person who initiated Gardner and he points emphatically to another woman who may have been hiding behind a smokescreen of Gardner's creation. Similarly, Hutton is not afraid to take on the now-taken-for-granted notion advanced by Aidan Kelly that the ritual nudity and scourging involved in Gardnerian Wicca were simply manifestations of Gardner's personal sexual kinks. Hutton ransacks Gardner's personal collection of pornography to refute this--and offers suggestions as to the real roots of these practices.The book is of greatest interest to the general (read, &quot;non-Wiccan&quot;) Neopagan reader in two regards. First, Hutton clearly demonstrates that the cultural roots of the Pagan revival lie embedded in the Romantic movement, particularly in Romantic Era poetry. The real forebears of the movement are seen to be, not Leland or Crowley (though both are examined and acknowledged), but poets like Keats, Shelley and Swinburne, who first identified the feminine divine with Nature and who repopularized the use of classical Pagan deities like Diana and Pan, often against critical resistance. The way in which Hutton tracks the passage of these motifs from literature into religion is fascinating.Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON represents a scholarly book by an apparently non-Pagan historian (unlike Adler) who is willing to see past the herd of sacred cows he is slaughtering to point out the transcendent values of Neopaganism--Wiccan or otherwise. He is careful throughout the book never to reach categorical judgements against some deeply-held beliefs, even where the evidence might strongly point in that direction. And, in the final pages of the book, Hutton sets aside the persona of the dispassionate researcher to advocate for pagan witchcraft as &quot;a full-blown, independent religion,&quot; one &quot;which deliberately draws upon ancient images and ideas for comtemporary needs,&quot; a protean faith which &quot;takes ideas from many sources and applies them in many--and often constantly altering--ways.&quot; Hutton hinted at this favorable sentiment in PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES and it is to his credit that he is willing to expand upon it here.Even speaking as an initiate in one of the traditions critically examined in the book (&quot;1734&quot; Witchcraft), I recommend it highly.",book
1598,"Hutton has written a book that truly needed to be written, unlike the vast majority of texts on the history of modern pagan witchcraft, for and against. In essence, Hutton isn't for or against; he's an historian. This approach may well annoy those looking for support for their beliefs, of course, but for those interested in a dispassionate account, this is the book to buy.Hutton really starts with the eighteenth century, with Masonry, ""cunning men"", and other magic-workers of various kinds. He discusses these folks as sources for the later witchcraft revival, and gives his sources scrupulously. He then moves on to the nineteenth-century ""occult revival"", which is only rather sketchily handled, and to Gardner and the whole complex from which he arose.Next, Hutton discusses Gardner in considerable detail, considering the whole ""Dorothy Clutterbuck"" problem and the whole complex of the first Wiccan covens. It seems not unlikely that this discussion will infuriate those who don't want to think of Gardner as a spiritual ancestor for their modern practices. At the same time, it's likely to tick off those would-be ""debunkers"" who want a lurid account of Gardner the evil sex-maniac. Overall, I found that Gardner came off rather sympathetically, which surprised me.For me, the best thing about the book is the discussion of the extension of Wicca past Gardner's own influence. For example, I tend to associate the rise of Neopaganism with liberal politics, given the strong affiliations with the rise of feminism, ecological activism, and a kind of back-to-the-earth approach to collapsing the modern military-industrial dominance of (especially) American economics and politics. But Hutton demonstrates that in the first half of the century, in England, Wicca was very much a right-wing movement, not entirely divorced from movements like Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the Kibbo Kift. The transition from right to left, concurrent with the switch from one side of the Atlantic to the other, is fascinating, and deftly handled by Hutton.I suppose the book is somewhat dense, if you're not used to mildly academic prose, but by academic standards it's pretty breezy reading. The book is quite accessible, as it is carefully indexed and Hutton makes clear what he's doing and why. If you are interested in a fairly direct, straightforward history of Neopagan witchcraft, this is a great book.You will hate this book if:1) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a surviving ancient pagan religion, continuing underground despite centuries of oppression; or2) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a load of nonsense, made up by some foolish sex-crazed women, which offers no spiritual rewards to anyone with half a brain.You will love this book if:1) You are willing to read some rather dense, careful historical prose, in a mildly academic style; and2) You would genuinely like to know a good deal about the ins and outs of the origins of the modern pagan witchcraft revival, and how it has developed over the last century.",book
1599,"Hutton, for those who haven't read his work, is a British historian whose previous major work has been several works on Charles II through the Glorious Revolution; as well as The pagan religions of the ancient British Isles (about the documentable religions and religious practices of pre-Christian Britain), The rise and fall of merry England: the ritual year, 1400-1700 (a history of festivals and holidays in Britain), and Stations of the Sun (the ritual year in Britain and its history). Essentially the latter two look at the same overall field of evidence from two different angles, triangulating on the fact that the most ancient festivals and holidays that are claimed to stretch back to the ancient pagan past, can (virtually) all be documented to have developed in the late medieval and post-medieval world.If you can't see the pattern here, his interest seems to have been trying to back-track elements of modern pagan tradition and mythology. It should be noted that at no time does he ever stray from his essential (and frequently stated) premise - that modern paganism is a perfectly valid modern religious format.It is from this foundation that he finally takes the leap in his Triumph of the Moon, wherein he examines the history of modern paganism and places it into its place in a larger counter-cultural tradition stretching back at least to the Romantic period (if you've seen his article on the Great Neolithic Goddess Cult that appeared in Antiquity several years ago, you may have some idea of where the path this has taken). He discusses what he sees as the essential elements of Language (what do we mean by &quot;paganism&quot;), Goddess, God, Stucture (basically Freemasonic), High Magic, Low Magic, Folklore (Golden Bough and Frazer's followers), Witchcraft (such as Murray and Leland), and the Matrix of post-Victorian England in which all of these &quot;Macrocosmic&quot; elements were brought together and influenced by the works of Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune and Robert Graves. His short biographies of these three range from the balanced and thoughtful (Crowley) to the somewhat more aggressive (Graves).From this birthplace, he examines the history of Gardner and his genealogy, re-examining the same old information with the perspective of (at least what looks like) objectivity - noting the different emergent groups that appear (and rather than simply assuming that they are &quot;Gardnerian offshoots&quot; noting the influences when they are there, but also examining their individual histories). He also notes and describes the earlier scholarly works that have preceded him into this field, from Aiden Kelly and Margot Adler to Tanya Luhrmann and others -- as well as their influences and the influences of their material on neo-Paganism as a whole.His conclusion presents a snapshot of pagan witchcraft at the end of the 20th century in Britain. I make that specific, since covens are still a little more the norm in Britain than they are here in the US. Very nice work, all in all. He does not, in my opinion, lose his objectivity for the most part - and when he does it's to lean more towards the feelings of the people he's studied. For example, his treatment of the Neolithic Mother Goddess, in this work, while clearly showing the implausibility, does not exclude its possibility.In short, if you are truly interested in the history of neo-Paganism, read it. It's worth it - you may not always agree with him (I know I don't), but he will give you a fresh perspective.",book
1600,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will give you all the details on how Wicca came to be created in the mid-twentieth century, based on literary, artistic, and academic fashions, the practices of fraternal orders and occult societies, old and new folk customs, and other cultural roots (real and imagined) going back to the 1700s. Hutton leaves no hope for those who wish to believe in a constantly existing Pagan religion in Britain or in a connection between the early modern witch trials and Paganism. No one can claim to be knowledgeable about the true history of modern Witchcraft who has not read and carefully studied this text.This meticulously documented book pounds the final nails into the coffin of the claims Gardner made (and others inflated) that Wicca was an ancient surviving British Pagan religion of Witchcraft. None but the most stubbornly fundamentalist of Orthodox Wiccans can deny it any longer, though they have continued to try.Hutton's work supports and amplifies the research into Wiccan history that I and other modern writers have done over the last thirty years. Indeed, the chapters in my book Bonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca on Gerald Gardner and the birth of Wicca owe a great deal to his clear exposition of complex details.Every Wiccan should have this book on their shelves.A PS for 2006: Many of the complaints by other reviewers here seem to me to be attempts to substitute unverified (and deliberately unverifiable) claims by modern Pagan authors to ""secret evidence"" they supposedly have access to that Hutton did not. Others are attempts to use misdirection by saying that Classical religions had (and Classical writers mentioned) goddesses similar to what modern Wicca has and ""therefore"" Wicca is ancient. No, because Gerald Gardner studied those ancient religions and read many of those Classical authors. Just using bits and pieces of something old in your invention doesn't constitute ""proof"" that your invention is itself old. Gardner was a brilliant creative artist who started something wonderful. Let's give him the credit he deserves and stop trying to shoot the messengers who have revealed his creative efforts. As for Hutton, I know him personally, and I know that he is far from being a ""hostile enemy"" to Wicca, being instead a sympathetic yet honest scholar. The Neopagan movement needs more authors like Hutton, not fewer.",book
1601,"Finally, a historian has written a book that details the origins of modern Witchcraft and Wicca. And said historian actually did a great deal of research and backs up his thesis with factual, primary source material, as opposed to the usual fantastical wish-fulfillment claptrap that many Neo-Pagan authors use to support thier pet theories regarding the history of Witchcraft.Some people will be disappointed in this book, no doubt, for nowhere does Hutton mention an unbroken lineage of Witches that stretches beyond the burning times far into the dim reaches of matriarchal prehistory where all the women were strong, the men were beautiful, and the children were peaceful and never hit each other over the head with rocks whilst playing oppressive, competitive male-oriented team sports.What this book does detail is a plausible explaination as to -why- modern Witchcraft would arise at all, and how it fits into post industrial society. I cannot praise the fact that Hutton doesn't only delve into the history of Witchcraft, but he shows us why it is important in the first place, and what it has to say about society as a whole, and Neo-Pagans in specific.The book is well-written, if densely packed with information. It is not an easy read; if one skims, one is apt to miss essential details and lose sight of the myriad threads that Hutton traces in his search for the warp and weft of Witchcraft today. I took my time reading this book, savoring it with rhapsodic glee: it was good to find that there was an academic who had actually taken the time to prove some of my own pet theories about Witchcraft in England during the modern period.At any rate, this book belongs on the shelf of every literate and educated Witch, Wiccan and Neo-Pagan in the world. If we Witches ever got around to opening up schools, I believe this should be a standard history text for any class that includes the study of our religious beliefs. It is always important to know where one comes from, in order to better decide where one would like to go.",book
1602,"The Pagan community has needed a book like this for two generations now -- scholarly, erudite, respectful, and documented well enough to meet academic standards rather than the standards of the popular press.A friend of mine bought it for me from the UK a few months before it came out in the States, and I haven't put it down. I haven't chased down footnotes with such vigor since I got out of graduate school.My only regret is that this book is an academic's research -- written for other academics. It's hardly dry for academic historians and folklorists, but I wonder how accessible it is to the lay audience, who need it most.",book
1603,"Wow, do I know I lot of people who need to read this!Someone, and a respected historian-someone at that, has finally done it - and I only hope that there is more to come!I came across this book in a university course and I can only say that I am deeply grateful to know that something like it has finally been written. Why didn't anyone mention it to me before huh? - I thought this was bound to be a standard work on every Wiccan's, Witch's or Pagan's bookshelf, right next to Margot Adler's ""Drawing Down The Moon""!Hutton's book is an in-depth study of the backgrounds, origins and development of modern Pagan witchcraft. Although it mainly focuses on Britain and on Wicca, it certainly provides a lot of ""where-from"" information on Neo-Paganism in general as well.The first part of the book - ""Macrocosm"" - is a thorough study of the larger context, which in 1800-1940 Britain made it possible that something like Wicca could evolve. It deals with Romantic literature, archaeology, the 'cunning folk' and popular 'low magic', European learned 'high magic', folklore, secret societies, Theosophy, the Order of the Golden Dawn and Freemasonry etc. etc.The second part - ""Microcosm"" - deals with the actual development of Wiccan traditions as they are practised today, starting with Gerald Gardner, then moving on to other important figures (such as Doreen Valiente etc.) and describing the development of other Wiccan traditions and also assumedly-independent-from-Wicca witchcraft traditions. Hutton also acknowledges the importance of the USA and how Wicca was greatly changed by the left-wing feminist attitude of American practitioners.Although not written academically dry it is certainly no light read, just because of the sheer mass of information it includes, but it will be worth the effort, trust me.Seldom have I read a book so packed full of things that I have always wanted to know and wondered about. I even know my share about Freemasonry now ;). The enormous research behind it and excessive end-notes satisfy even my sceptical mind. Hey, finally someone tries to PROVE what they are saying! It is therefore also a great sourcebook and basic work for further studies of your own.However, for those who firmly believe in an unbroken continuity of Wicca from before the burning times, it is certainly a challenge, because Hutton does away with this theory most thoroughly. - But he does so in a very kind way, showing that there really is no need to justify a perfectly acceptable modern religion by means of these ""ancient roots"", and that, even if modern Pagans do pick and choose from actual older sources&religions;, they are creating something uniquely modern, but nonetheless perfectly valid in the process.The only two drawbacks are the tiny tiny tiny printing in the paperback, which has me longing for the hardcover edition - hopefully printed larger so that I can read it again and again without needing a magnifying glass or ruining my eyes.The other is that for someone completely new to the subject it is probably sometimes hard to understand what it is all about, especially since Hutton includes so much detailed information.If you've never heard of modern witchcraft, Wicca or Paganism, read ""Drawing Down The Moon"" first - then you can truly enjoy ""The Triumph Of The Moon"".",book
1604,"Hutton has performed an outstanding service to scholarship with this study. Avoiding politics and polemics, he provides the historical roots of a phenomenon clearly of recent invention. Pagan, Druidic and Wiccan organizations dwell on their roots from a distant past. Hutton shows their origins are in more modern literature and structured on organizations such as the Freemasons. There are, he emphasizes without rancour, no truly verifiable ancient origins for modern witchcraft. Although some readers may be deterred by the scholarly tone of this work, it is precisely Hutton's detached view of these social phenomena that has been lacking. He has filled a long-vacant niche and done it gracefully. More importantly, he's given us a valuable history that will endure.The underlying theme is clear - the claims of modern pagans, ""wiccans"" and other occult groups to clear roots deep in prehistoric times is invalid. Hutton's research reveals the creation of various gods and goddesses arose from 18th Century literature. None of the Enlightenment or Romantic era writers used valid sources to claims that Pan, Diana or other ""natural"" deities persisted into modern times. All of the themes of ""earth"" or ""cosmic"" religions resulted from some disaffection - usually, but not always, with rigid Christianity. These literary creations found a ready readership, usually among intellectuals, later with a wider public, disillusioned in no small part by the social disruptions of industrialising Britain. A ""return to nature"" and its fabricated deities was an alluring solution to perceived woes. The pivotal event in translating this literary background for modern audiences, of course, was the publication of James Frazer's ""The Golden Bough"". Given the paucity of substance in that book, it's astonishing to learn it remains in print.As Hutton leads us through the groves of literary invention, he frequently points out the brambles encountered. It's easy to become ensnared by enthusiasm replacing scholarship. Phrases like ""without sources"", ""no research"" and ""leaping beyond evidence"" occur with depressing frequency. Yet note the lack of ""fabricated"", ""contrived"", or ""invented"". Hutton is at pains to show that however ephemeral the origins, these writers, and their avid readers, firmly believe in what they say. What they believe in appears to vary with each individual, but that seems to be the nature of religions, ancient or modern, according to Hutton. Pan, for example, is mischievous, diabolical, sexually rampant or idyllic in turn as successive writers portrayed him over the decades.The research underlying this study is staggering. Over fifty pages of annotated bibliography plus numerous interviews and personal correspondence support this work. He even manages to work in The X-Files and Terry Pratchett's Discworld series! Hutton's crowded reading schedule offers a hedgehog of pointers for the interested, but the book must be read closely to determine which are worth following. Some sources are more noteworthy than others, of course. If modern Paganism can be said to have a ""founder"" it is in the figure of Gerald Gardner. His writings, most of which fall into Hutton's scanty resource base category, initiated the wave of pagan witchcraft active in Britain and America today. Hutton shows how, despite schisms and divergences, Gardner's idea crossed the Atlantic to find ready acceptance in North America. There, merged with radical feminism, it not only took root, but rebounded across the sea to reinvigorate the British pagan movement. However, lack of cohesion leads Hutton to view it as having a ""luxuriant complexity"".Hutton is at pains to avoid blemishing his study with ""reactivity"" or ""reflexivity"". The former, he explains, is influencing the beliefs or behaviour of those under study. ""Reflexivity"" is what the historian undergoes when examining his own motives and reactions to the information acquired. He steadfastly rejects the second while striving to minimize the first. It's a difficult balance, but he has achieved both successfully. The only real shortcoming in this book are the typos - jarring in a work published by an academic press. One might like some illustrative material to break the monotony of text. He also fails to list any Web sources. Even with the vaporous nature of Internet sites, some of the organizations he cites can be found. None of these limitations fail to intrude on a worthwhile and important study of an overlooked phenomenon. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",book
1605,"Ronald Hutton's Triumph Of The Moon is an excellent historical study and exploratory overview of Wicca. Since its history is an extremely volatile and complex subject, in his preface Hutton is wisely modest about the present limits of the information available to scholars and the scope of his abilities and intentions-no promises to absolute knowledge are made. Hutton clearly realizes that his subject is a matter of belief and faith to Wicca's adherents, and therefore his careful conclusions are largely relative and theoretical. His writing style is plain-spoken and academic, his approach studiously matter-of-fact throughout.Since he is a historian and not a psychologist, Hutton steers away from any investigation of the archetypal witch image as a apparent constant of the human psyche and condition, focusing instead on whatever traceable elements of a genuine `witch tradition' and survival existed and exist in fact. Considering that witches appear both everywhere and nowhere throughout history, Hutton pulls off a remarkable piece of speculative detective work. He remains uncommonly fair and open-minded throughout, considering all claims equally and going so far as to express that he does not deny the possibility that the gods and goddesses of Wicca-including Pan--exist objectively. If this is a simple placating measure, Hutton handles it with aplomb.The author states that the most important argument of his book is that Wicca is the result of a combination of cultural forces and undertones that have developed in England since 1800, including the Murray thesis as a erroneous theory and modern myth rather than as a hypothesis having any basis in fact.But it's not difficult to believe that some remnant of pre-Christian religions existed in dynamic form during the Middle Ages, continued to be practiced and came to be identified as witchcraft by the dominant Christian establishment. This proposed pagan religion-presumably some form of nature worship-may have not been a focused, formalized religion in fact, but something more akin to Ireland's `fairy faith'-a powerful belief system that took a wide variety of forms in diverse parts of Europe.Since veneration of different aspects of nature as a means of insuring a bountiful harvest seems to be a fairly common and probably spontaneous phenomena among man when in the early stages of development, why should some trace of this not have continued into the Middle Ages among agrarian people? Murray may have been all wrong in her both carefully and carelessly built-up specifics, but at least partially correct generally. Though Carlo Ginzburg was apparently unclear about how or if to link his discovery of the benandanti in the Fruili region to Murray's thesis, the example Hutton gives of the century-old witch community on the Welsh island of Mon is fairly impressive, especially since he is able to identify at least three other `pagan witch traditions' older than and apparently independent of Gardnerian Wicca.Among those who helped produce `the pool of ideas and impulses' which led or may have contributed to the formation of Wicca are key figures James Frazer, James Michelet, Margaret Murray, Charles Godfrey Leland, Samuel Liddell Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, and Dion Fortune, each of whose work Hutton carefully considers.Hutton clearly loves his subject; the reader senses that no one would secretly enjoy discovering solid proof of a pagan survival of this kind more than he. His sympathy, however, never compromises his rigorous scholarly standards. This is a cautious, well-considered and erudite book that should educate most and offend few.",book
1606,"As several people have already said here, the incomparable Ronald Hutton has done the Pagan community an immense service with _Triumph of the Moon_. Indeed, he achieves the near-impossible: he has produced an academic monograph on the origins of modern Pagan witchcraft capable of satisfying those on the inside (Pagans) _and_ those on the outside (academics and society at large).Hutton brings his characteristic wit and penetrating insight to bear upon the 'history' of modern witchcraft, and the result is simultaneously a sobering and an uplifting read. This is no mere hatchet job on the always-shaky historical claims of Gardner _et al_; it is a wide-ranging and extremely intelligent study of social, intellectual and spiritual trends in Britain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which places the modern Craft in its worldly context. A succession of poets, academics, cunning folk, anthropologists, Masons and occultists are discussed, illuminating social currents of the day, and exploring the contribution of each to the great mosaic that became the modern Craft.The myths, too, are explored: Margaret Murray, 'the burning times', Gardner's Book of Shadows and the myth of prehistoric 'Great Goddess' are all carefully examined, and gently (or not so gently) punctured. Yet I cannot emphasise enough that this is not an attack on Paganism - that it can only, in fact, make it stronger. The first (Gardnerian) witches' claims to the antiquity of their tradition may have been spurious, but Hutton makes it clear that this removes nothing from the fact that there was 'something in the water', so to speak, of early twentieth century society. Far from appearing a deceitful aberration, Gardner and others are shown to be expressive of a mood of their times, taking the logical next step in giving Paganism a structure and greater definition.Two caveats (because I feel I ought to...): 1) The focus - both in historial chapters and in the sociological case study at the end - is upon coven witchcraft, with little space for solitary workers (although this is perfectly reasonable in terms of what Hutton is trying to); 2) From an article in 'Pagan Dawn' a little while back, I gather that Hutton's research is ongoing, and there's a possibility of a second edition at some point in the future!Hutton is an engaging and lucid writer, as adept at discussing long-term social trends as he is at providing lively pen-portraits of the various writers and witches who parade through his pages. An enjoyable and an enlightening read for anyone with an interest in the Craft or in 20th century social history. Wonderful.",book
1607,"...is that there is much less to it than meets the eye. This book is a brilliant scholarly study by a fine professional historian. This is important because much of the attraction of witchcraft or paganism, both to its adherents and to the wider society as a whole is that it appeals to deep intutions and fears about history and the past. Whatever happened to the pre-Christian religions of Europe? Are there people who consciously worship the Devil? Is there a continuous history of pagan religion that has lasted to the present day? What were the deep roots behind the savagery of the witch trials?It is one of the invaluable merits of this book that Hutton answers these questions, which are, respectively, it died out, no, no, and not misogyny. Hutton shows considerable sympathy to the modern witches and pagans. Without them, after all he would not have been able to write this book. Yet Hutton is quite thorough that their main belief, that they are reviving a pre-Christian past that in some way or another is superior to Christianity and to our modern society, is false. ""...the unique significance of pagan witchcraft to history is that it is the only religion which England has ever given the world.""Some historical context is needed, and Hutton provides it throughout the book. In the 1920s Margaret Murray came out with the thesis that the witchcraft trials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were actually directed against a real religion, an organized Pagan religion which was the common religion of Europe that underlay a superficial Christianity. Associated with this view and slowly developing later was that the witchcraft trials were savagely misogynist attacks against women. This view has been the backbone of pagan propaganda for decades and it is only now changing because it is increasingly clear that it is untrue in every major respect. To argue that there were really witch ceremonies, Murray deliberately excluded all the supernatural elements in the trial testimony, making it look more sober and rational (and non-coerced by torture) than it really was. Contrary to myth, 9 million women were not burned, but only 50,000 people in total. A majority were women (though in some areas of Europe most were men), but contrary to myth, midwives were not specifically singled out (indeed they helped to look for suspects), and many of the poor isolated people accused were themselves denounced by women. The idea that people were only superficially Christian is clearly inaccurate as scholars such as Christopher Haigh and Eamon Duffy have shown the strength of Roman Catholicism before the Reformation and its hegemony (scholars have also shown that the oral-literate distinction has been much overstated in modern England.) Hutton is quite good on how folklorists saw customs that clearly developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be pagan revivials. He points out how the distinguished archaeologist of the Baltic, Marija Gimbutas, became so obsessed with the idea of a Pan-European Goddess religion that she ignored that the supposedly ""Goddess"" English superhenges were actually a thousand years later than the supposedly ""patriarchal"" Irish Linkardsdtown cists that supposedly replaced them.But Hutton is more than a debunker. The first half of the book goes into detail about the wider cultural influences that encouraged a revival of Paganism in 19th and 20th century Britain. He discusses as part of the decline of Anglicanism how even rather stalwart figures like Kipling and H. Rider Haggard looked to something more exotic. He discusses the enthusiasm for Pan and the belief in a primoridal Goddess. There is a very useful chapter on the origins of freemasonry, which should be read by all those who believe the myth that Jack the Ripper was somehow involved with the Prince of Wales. He also provides a chapter on cunning magic and low magic (were cunning men and white magic representatives of a pagan religion. Short answer: No. In fact they were just as religious (or no more religious)as the wider society.This covers the first half of the book, and the second half covers the second half as an actual neo-pagan religion developed. Although many witches and pagans today emphasize their feminism and environmentalism, leading pagans like Aleister Crowley and Gerald Gardner were actually tories. (The one truly unforgiveable thing about Crowley in fact was his anti-semitism.) Although Hutton shows commendable patience and tolerance with his informants he does show that there is no evidence of a continous pagan religion. Indeed, there is little reliable evidence that any witches can date back their practices before the second world war. Gibbon once wickedly commented that one reason that Romans believed that Christians were guilty of preposterous crimes like incest and cannibalism was because Christian sects so often flung such accusations at each other. Hutton notes the same problems about modern witches, though he clearly points out that there is no evidence they were guilty of anything (promiscuity isn't even mandatory!) criminal. He is also properly sympathetic to those who were foully libelled and their lives damaged by irresponsible and malicious press campaigns.One interesting point that Hutton does not fully emphasize is that both the interest in paganism and the paranoid fear of Satanism is both the product of the decline of Christianity. After all, before the Enlightenment Christians did not fear an organized conspiracy of Satanists. Either they feared other Christians (Protestants vs. Catholic vs. Orthodox) or they feared Islam. More could be said also about neo-paganism and the one really existing pre-Christian religion, Judaism. But otherwise this is a fascinating book and in the end Hutton points out that modern witchcraft is not a sect or a cult or a New Age Movement or a nature religion. Personally, I think we would all be better off reading Adorno.",book
1608,"This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!",book
1609,"Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton ...When I picked up Hutton, the rather dry introduction was almost enough to turn me off. The man is not a Wiccan writer -- he is a historian... and the intro had all the ""dryness"" associated with that subject.Once I began on the text, however, I was truly impressed. I had expected a ""history of the movement"" similar to Drawing Down the Moon (by Margot Adler). Instead, this was an examination of the roots of the movement, and the things that influenced those roots.It is both readable and well-documented. Hutton takes a historian's view -- starting not with Gardner, but with Byron -- following all the influences that led to the birth of the modern Wiccan religion. In the process, he sheds light on a number of ""mysteries"" that many people (myself included) had assumed would never really be solved.Not stopping with Gardner, he then follows the movement forward in time, introducing a number of prominent figures in the Wiccan world, and delving into their background, influences, and credibility, and showing how they fit into the ""big picture"". In the process, he examines how American Wicca has grown differently than British Wicca, and the cultural reasons for those differences.In addition to being well-written, the book is well-documented. Hutton never asserts something as fact without telling you his source. (Too many Pagan books forget this basic rule.) If you had the time, energy, & resources, you could duplicate his research with the information he gives.He uses the facts to blow up a lot of cherished Wiccan myths, but he does so with compassion. And in such a way that you realize the myths are not necessary to follow this path... and may even detract from it.I do not always agree with Hutton's conclusions about the material he presents. (He tends to err on the side of acceptance, where I'm a bit more hard-nosed.) And I hesitate to give any single source my full support. But until we have more work of this caliber, Triumph of the Moon should be on everyone's reading list... if only so that they get their facts straight.",book
1610,"The Triumph of the Moon is the first full length and wide-ranging history of Wicca ever published. It is written by Dr. Ronald Hutton who is professor of history at the University of Bristol. Hutton has created the defining text on the subject--his research is wide and well documented and his theories tend to be fair and carefully argued. In addition to providing a great deal of information about the immediate events surrounding Gerald Gardner and others, Hutton provides the essential historical, social, and cultural context into which Wicca entered the world. This text requires some patience and time to read, as it is long and comprehensive, but it is required reading for anyone deeply interested in Wicca's history.",book
1611,"I just finished reading this excellent book and was disappointed to see several negative reviews-- just because the font size in the paperback is small.As much as Mr. Hutton deserves his royalties, I recommend that you get the hard back (it has reasonable sized font) from your library and read this well-written, fascinating book. You'll learn things about modern paganism and western culture that I don't think you'd find anywhere else.As there are nearly a hundred reviews here already, I'll keep my comments brief-- or at least briefer than they would be otherwise. Each chapter is devoted to one element that contributed to the rise of modern paganism including Greek literature, the invention of ""ancient,"" secret societies, local practitioners of spells and curses, poetry, literature (and trashy novels), scholarship, politics, and other elements. It could have been a dry, dull book of interest only to modern pagans. However, I had FUN reading it; how often can you say that about non-fiction?The author debunks a number of common ideas, so a modern pagan might (or might not) be disturbed by some of the information. (I myself was a bit disappointed in Robert Graves and Mary Daly.) However, I agree with the author's statement that none of his findings invalidate the religion. I think that his research reveals how much our culture longed for and perhaps needed modern paganism.The subject was interesting-- but for me, how the author approached the subject was even more interesting. First, he spent years researching. Second, he treated the people and ideas with an immense amount of respect; it shines through every word. Third, he was objective and fair; he seemed deeply interested in the truth. Even when he had gathered and presented significant evidence for one conclusion, he didn't omit other possible interpretations of the same facts. Fourth, his thinking and analysis of ideas is so clear; he's able to discern problems in cases where I'd never have seen them. I want to sit down with Mr. Hutton and discuss how he did his research and writing. What a scholar!",book
1612,"This book should be in every Wiccan's bookshelf, and in every student's first purchase box.That said, it isn't a Wiccan book.To put it bluntly, this is the book that serves as a sort of flashlight for any pagan research. Erroneous claims, fraudlent histories and silly ranting about who came first seems to dissolve like fog in the sun in its presence.Excellent for Wiccans and people wanting to understand them, perhaps not so good for those who capitalize on the frauds it exposes.",book
1613,"So much information is within this book as to origins and influences on many modern-day Wiccan practices! I've recommended this book to many Wiccans and pagans, alike. I've given it to several priestesses, and plan to buy more copies for others in the future. The information is sometimes astonishing, and always well-researched. As a Wiccan of over 25 years, I think it's one of the best books on the subject of modern Wicca that I've seen. A must for historians, students, and followers of the Craft.",book
1614,"I have seen several negative reviews about this book, and that's ok. some people don't want to have their precious castles in the sky brought down to Earth. but for the rest of us, we have this wonderful book.I think the major advantage to this book is that it was written by a non-pagan. He cannot be accused of revisionism, nor can he be accused of choosing one form of Witchcraft over another. He is outside the &quot;Witch Wars&quot;, and that helps him greatly. He is a historian with nothing to gain or lose from debunking the &quot;wicca-is-as-old-as-man&quot; myth. finally!Hutton discusses a number of names in the history of the Craft, both big and small. Gardner, Sanders, Crowley, Valiente, Murray, Graves..none are immune from either Hutton's praise or question. I suspect that what most people find so good about this book is the sheer number of people the author has spoken to in addition to the number of texts he has read.Several people have accused Hutton of tunnel-vision. here is my reply. if your idea of history is some pseudo-scientific drivel, you're welcome to it! Graves rewrote the myth of Hekate, Gardner borrowed whatever he could from every source availible to him, Leland may have been wrong and mislead a la Mead, and Murray made up a lot of her statistics and revised a lot of history. what disturbs these reviewers isn't that Hutton is right or wrong, but that the &quot;Gospel of Gardner/Leland/Murray/Graves&quot; has been challenged.it is about time that someone stepped up to the plate and gave the world a book such as this. new doesn't equal bad, i don't know why some of these reviewers are all wound up. my only complaint about the book...Oxford Press: could you have made the print any smaller?!?",book
1615,"Ronald Hutton is professor of history at University of Bristol, and quite possibly the foremost academic authority on Wicca--modern pagan witchcraft. His hypothesis is relatively straightforward: Wicca is the only religion England has ever given the world; it is not the same thing as witchcraft, but a modern synthesis of a great many historical events and intellectual currents.Throughout recorded history, one finds evidence of witchcraft and occult practices. But Wicca, properly so called, is the brainchild of Gerald Gardner. Gardner was an Englishman who spent much of his life as the owner of tea and rubber plantations in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), North Borneo, and Malaya, and who later worked as an inspector in the Malay customs service. In 1936, at age 52, Gardner retired to England. After a series of encounters with other occultists (including the notorious Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis, and someone whom Gardner calls ""Old Dorothy""), and his own research and inquiries, Gardner published in 1949 a novel entitled ""High Magic's Aid,"" which he claimed contains beliefs and rituals of the alleged witches with whom he worked. In 1951, England repealed the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Act, allowing witches to practice more openly. And in 1954, Gardner brought out his second book, ""Witchcraft Today,"" in which he posed as a disinterested anthropologist lucky enough to have discovered surviving covens practicing a secret initiatory system of pagan religion, a religion that Gardner claimed stretched back into antiquity over millenia.But Professor Hutton demonstrates, to my satisfaction at least, that this isn't really what occurred. Instead, Hutton claims, Gerald Gardner drew on a wide disparity of sources and subject matters, and on his own and others' misinterpretations and misunderstandings of history, to synthesize his own version of what he believed witchcraft ought to be, a normative rather than empirical phenomenon. Gardnerian Wicca is therefore the product of Gerald Gardner's creative genius. Hutton also clarifies the relationships among the various descendants and step-children of Gardnerian Wicca.Professor Hutton tells this story with supreme craftsmanship and elan. A lesser analytical talent might be overwhelmed with the vast amount of source material; such an inferior author might also confuse the various strands, or fail to trace properly the various twists of the tale. Red herrings indeed abound in this story, but Professor Hutton does not fall for them, nor allow them to divert him from the book's main task. He skilfully weaves all the various threads together.At book's end, the careful reader has been enlightened, confusion dispelled, not increased. This reader, who has paid properly close attention to what Professor Hutton has to say, will find her understanding of Wicca and its origins greatly enhanced, and will not be so credulous when confronting Wiccan claims of its immense antiquity. Professor Hutton succeeds in the task he sets for himself. By taking us along in the journey, we have not only been vastly entertained, but enlightened. Bravo!",book
1616,"Despite being horrifically overwritten, this book pays little attention to its subject.Most of the book is disparaging comments about what other authors have written on a variety of topics; the relevance to witchcraft is never explained. There is no thesis statement to aid us in attempting to connect the material on our own.Although he criticizes everyone else across a myriad of subjects, he never presents the corrected view. He would have done better to at least establish his hypothesis up front and tell us how each chapter contributes to proving it.The subtitle says this is a history. The only history it contains is brief discussions of Gardner, Sanders, feminist Wicca and the Craft's purported reluctance to acknowledge modern historians. He claims the latter agree few people were killed as witches during the Burning Times (he doesn't give a number) and that sabbats mentioned during those trials were wholly fictitious (he doesn't explain why one would ignore the trial testimony to reach this conclusion).Of Gardner's greatest controversy (did he inherit or invent), the author draws no conclusion.Unacknowledged by the subtitle is the limitation of the work to British witchcraft except for a foray into how American feminist Wicca influenced British Craft.It's as if Schlesinger's ""A Thousand Days"" mentioned JFK's birth, talked about his performance in first grade, discussed his sisters and spent the rest of the time disparaging other books about presidents from McKinley on up and bootleggers. Would anyone call that history?Hutton's definition of ""close acquaintance"" (his words) with various covens includes those he visited *once*. His experience was exclusively with witches in covens which, I suspect, were the minority of witches even at the time the author was working.This is hardly ""a history of modern pagan witchcraft"" which the subtitle claims.As the author writes (bashing yet another predecessor), ""The quantity of actual ... historical information contained here is minimal ... "" (Kindle location 4883-86), a judgment which aptly describes his own work in the present book.",book
1617,"""Another such Triumph and we are ruined."" Pyrrhus 279 BCEUpdate added 9-7-2006. I am delighted to see that my review has inspired an army of Hutton-devotees to slap together substance-free positive reviews in order to try to counteract my negative review of ""Triumph of the Moon"" (see below). Prior to my review there had been only two reviews posted in the previous two years - but since my review there has been at least one a month! It's nice to be noticed. Thanks everyone! Now, on to the review itself.If Pagans are a little vague about exactly how our religion has survived, and a little awkward about exactly how our rites and rituals work, and if we sometimes make up stories to fill in the gaps in our history - maybe there's good reason for that. Maybe our sacred books were burned, and our Priestesses and Priests murdered, and our sacred places desecrated and destroyed. Maybe our Religion has been the target of a sustained campaign to destroy it!The simple fact is that Religions are very resilient things. They do not die easily. And when they are forced underground they sometimes change in strange and unexpected ways. Does anyone deny that Paganism was forced underground? Many religions have survived under similar circumstances - why must Pagans accept the triumphalist conclusions of our enemies that they succeeded in destroying our Religion? Why can't we just say ""we're not dead yet""?Well, we're not dead. So there. Any person of good will would be sympathetic toward a Religion that has suffered so much persecution - and would be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to those who claim to be its continuators. And a good historian would much more carefully consider the evidence of Pagan survivals found in European intellectual, literary and artistic history, as well as in phenomena such as Alchemy, Qabalah, Magia, Astrology, the Tarot, etc.Here are some authors to read instead of Hutton:*** Pierre Hadot: Especially his ""What Is Ancient Philosophy?"" and ""The Inner Citadel"". Hadot is a serious philosopher who knows how to write about Ancient Philosophy for the intelligent non-specialist. These two books offer an excellent introduction to Pagan Philosophy!*** Perez Zagorin's ""Ways of Lying: Dissimulation Persecution and Conformity in Early Modern Europe"" on the phenomenon of underground Religious movements under Christendom. Also by Zagorin: ""How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West"" on the violent repression of intellectual and religious freedom under Christendom.*** Julia Annas: ""The Morality of Happiness"" and ""Platonic Ethics Old and New"". Whaddya know? The Christians didn't invent morality after all!*** Michael Gaddis: ""There is No Crime For Those Who Have Christ"" - sometimes a title says it all.*** Ramsay MacMullen: Especially his ""Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries"". This is THE book on the question ""what happened to Paganism?""*** Pierre Chuvin: ""Chronicle of the Last Pagans"" - this comes right after MacMullen's book as among the most essential things for Pagans to read about our history.*** Lynn Roller: her ""In Search of God the Mother"" is a meaty tome covering the three ""incarnations"", so to speak, of Cybele: in Her native Anatolia, in the Hellenistic World, as lastly as the Roman Magna Mater. Roller also includes a fascinating and devastating critique of the scholarly research on Cybele.*** Antonia Tripolitis: her ""Religions of the Hellnistic Roman Age"" provides an accessible but also reliable overview of the Religious landscape in prior to the suppression of Paganism.*** Sarah Iles Johnston: her ""Religions of the Ancient World"" is a coffee-table book that covers a very broad range of Religious traditions in the mediterranean world prior to the suppression of all other Religions by the Christians. Also by Johnston: ""Hekate Soteira"" is an essential scholarly reference on Theurgy and the role of the Chaldean Oracles in Late Antiquity.*** Philippe Borgeaud ""The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece"". Few aspects of Hutton's book demonstrate his ignorance of Paganism like his dismissal of the God Pan. Hutton ridicules the idea that Pan ever played a significant role in traditional Paganism. Hutton's theory is that Wiccans elevated Pan to a central role solely because of Pan's prominence in contemporary English language ""romantic"" literature. But of course Pan was a ""major player"" in Greek and Roman Paganism from the time of the battle of Marathon - as Borgeaud shows in this beautiful little book that every Pagan should read.*** Fraces Yates: Especially her ""The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age"", ""The Rosicrucian Enlightenment"" and ""Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition"".*** Gregory Shaw: ""Theurgy and the Soul: the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus"" Neoplatonism was the ""last known address"" of the classical Paganism of Antiquity - and it is the form in which Paganism begins to resurface during the Renaissance. Any genuine attempt to investigate whether or not Paganism managed to survive would not dismiss philosophical Paganism (and Platonism in particular) as a side issue, as Hutton does, but would make it a primary focus.*** Lucas Siorvanes: his ""Proclus: Neo-Platonic Philosophy and Science"" is another excellent book on Platonism as a Pagan philosophy in Late Antiquity.""Triumph of the Moon"" is an anti-Pagan book. It has enjoyed a free-ride from Pagans because the vast majority of Pagans have never read a book with footnotes before. After having their brains addled by the works of Scott Cunningham and Silver Ravenwolf, Pagans have eagerly acclaimed Hutton their favorite ""scholar"". But what is Hutton saying in this book? His main argument can be stated in five words: Paganism is a made-up Religion. If you believe that, then you'll love his book.Curt Steinmetz",book
1618,idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly.,book
1619,"Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community.",book
1620,"I have to admit that this book is well written, but it presents a very definite bias. It attempts to build a case for how modern witchcraft was invented and has no old roots at all, that nothing about witchcraft today has any connection to the witchcraft of the past. Instead, the roots of modern Craft stem from romanticized notions of the folklorist societies and so on. Which seems to disregard that the folklore societies had to get the info from somewhere.A close reading of the sections re Gerald Gardner has Hutton admitting that he can't really prove definitively that Gardner or the New Forest Coven made everything up...since everyone who was around at the time that he was using to collect his info from has proved to have not told the truth at one time or another, and there aren't enough documents available to scholars to sort fact from fiction.Some of Hutton's other works also go off of the claim that nothing survived the Reformation...a theory that is refuted by other authors, including Emma Wilby in her books. She insists that these practices and beliefs did survive among the country folk at least into the 1800's and that they kept it to themselves. Bringing these beliefs (even if fragmentary) into the 1800's brings it a lot closer to the old folks who were involved in the New Forest Coven and so closer to Gerald Gardner. There is no reason not to think that the New Forest Coven did not have at least a few of these old ideas, practices, and beliefs.Interesting book, but the theories are not proven. At least, not to my satisfaction. Try rounding out your own studies with Wilby, Ginzburg, and so on.",book
1621,"Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!",book
1622,This was an amazing booking. Very insightful and accurate. I would highly recommend this to all my friends who share the same belief as I do. I would also recommend this for anyone doing religious studies.,book
1623,"I have not finished reading the book. I have, however, found it hard to put down. It was engaging, comprehensive and enjoyable to read. I heard this book recommended by sales people in my city Halifax.It is without a doubt informative and accurate in the history of Witchcraft. I know it was preferred over other books on the history of Witchcraft.",book
1624,"When this book came in from the library, my first thought was, ""wow...finally...some serious scholarship on the subject."" And while this work is eminently cited in many books on its subject, it's neither an easy read nor particularly ground breaking in the arguments it makes and the history it provides.Now I should say I am no stranger to books published by academic presses, however, readability does matter to me and I just did not find it very accessible as a person overwhelmed in academic reading.In short, if someone was searching for a brief, realistic, and readable history of Wicca and Witchcraft, I would suggestBonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca, which covers much of the same ground (history of witchcraft in ancient, pre-modern, and modern times and the development of Wicca) in much more readable but still serious tone and style.",book
1625,"This is a masterful work of scholarship that examines not only the history of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, but also the social factors that led to its emergence. Every Pagan should read this book.",book
1626,"I bought this book to see how Hutton had connected the older traditions, not to read about Gardner and his ilk, which Hutton spent a little too much space on and that is my opinion and I am welcomed to it! However I thought that it was well done considering the immensity of the topic. There is quite a good amount of info on the old village healers, pellars, &quot;white witches&quot; (yes, damnit this term has historical origins before 1940)or whatever term was applied locally. I was disappointed about some of the information however. Hutton states that village healers did not attempt to cure fatal illness, that is not entirely true. Hutton also proves what some had already known, there were people who practiced and still DO practice Pre-Gardnerian traditions. (i.e. Andrew Chumbley!) Guess what? The Older Traditions practiced quite a bit of what could be called &quot;Christian Magic or &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. This little &quot;revelation&quot; will surely be a kick in the pants to some, as will other bits of info. that Hutton has written about. Read this book only if you want to have factual information. If you want to hang on to fantasies, Victorian pedophile fairies, puffy dragons and other froux- frouxs, then you probably can't muster up the courage for this one. Some people will be angered by this book and say that Hutton is just a musty old historian, which of course is the unscholarly type of person , who chews gum with open mouth and has a void expression on their face, without cessation.",book
1627,"Hutton pulls no punches when analyzing the origins of modern paganism and witchcraft. He is a forthright historian, and realizes that their are holes in the story, which of course will lend itself to further historical study. As a historian, he is serving the truth by searching out the record and putting it into a cohesive whole. He, as well as other historians, will have to take the story forward from the point where this book leaves off, but it is an excellent begining to the story.Hutton may not be correct in all of his analysis and synthesis, but he is an honest &quot;task master&quot;. This book cannot be ignored by either pagan nor non-pagan. It's analysis of British Witchcraft origins is to be commended, and hopefully, equally relevant works will be published concerning such orgins in other countries. Such &quot;other works&quot; may illuminate the whole structure of paganism and thus enhance our understanding and appreciation for the pagan world view.His analysis of modern witchcraft and it's practitioners is enlightening and revealing. So many of these practitioners are still around and it might be hoped that an historian exists, or one may be found presently training in graduate school, who would be willing to consolidate their thoughts on their own origins which could be left for those who will live after them and would like to know their thoughts on the matter.Hopefully, books like this may clear our minds about our own pagan origins and allow us to go forward with knowledge as a tool, rather than ignorance as a bliss.",book
1628,"Ronald Hutton really knows his subject, I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about Paganism. This book is a great read!",book
1629,"A good and detailed history of Paganism and Witchcraft, in the frame of Modern Age, at the Great Britain.Dr Hutton shows facts, events and persons whose help to ""delivery"" Paganism and Witchcraft to Modern and Contemporary Age. He agree more or less with Jeffrey Russel and Brooks Alexander that the modern paganism and witchcraft would be a religious movement fostered by de historical romantism. But the process of History can't be framed without any source of influences from previous facts, events and persons.But even then, it is a book that every pagan, witch and wiccan must to read.",book
1630,"From the second page of the preface, when Hutton states, &quot;If it [neo-Paganism] is the child of any single phenomenon, then it is the belated offspring of the Romantic Movement,&quot; I was entranced. This book offers a beautiful argument on how the style of British Romanticism underlies the growth of neo-Paganism, just as it chronicles the growth of the contemporary neo-Pagan myth. (Note: I do not use &quot;myth&quot; as a negative; myth is not falsehood; myth, at least for this Romantic, is metaphor.) The book is a delight from beginning to end: a very affirmative portrait of contemporary neo-Paganism and yet an honest picture. The false geneology that seems a standard part of the neo-Pagan litany is thoroughly rejected, but the spiritual richness of the Pagan revival is accepted as sincere. A great piece of history writing.",book
1631,"This book has made me rethink everything I have ever taken as &quot;fact&quot; regarding to Witchcraft. Published in 1999 by the Oxford University Press, this work is clearly held to very high academic standards. The book is divided into two sections, Macrocosm and Microcosm, with subdivisions including &quot;Finding a Goddess&quot;, &quot;Finding a Folklore,&quot; &quot;God (and Goddess) Parents,&quot; &quot;Gerald Gardner,&quot; &quot;Old Craft, New Craft,&quot; &quot;Uncle Sam and the Goddess,&quot; and &quot;Grandchildren of the Shadows.&quot;I mention the above to illustrate the wide context in which this book operates. It not only is interested in historical research devoted to what today's witches term &quot;the burning times,&quot; but also to the development of the modern witchcraft movement begun by Gardner. The manner in which Mr. Hutton presents the material is both academic and yet is readable-- he clearly states when his opinions are just that-- undocumented assumptions based on reason, versus that of proven ideas, thesis, etc. The earlier chapters are a little difficult to &quot;wade through&quot; at times, but the book is more reader friendly with each chapter.The reason Triumph of the Moon is so unique is because it provides facts little known to the general public that refute earlier research on the Witch Trials of the past as well as claims that the Wicca of today is a direct descendant of ancient pagan lineage.Although Mr. Hutton does not align himself with Wicca, Paginsim, or Witchcraft, he has been allowed to study, interview, and even circle with over 21 covens in England.This book is a must read for every Pagan, Wiccan, Witch or anyone interested in history. This is what history books should be printing",book
1632,"Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT.",book
1633,"Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton to my mind is an essential read for any practicing wiccan or witch. It's a historical book of two halves. The first half is an exploration & history of the facets that make up modern pagan witchcraft, such as the Goddess, the God, cunning folk, high ritual magic, secret societies, paganism etc, then the second half is an account of how the different strands came together. It's the first proper scholarly investigation by a respected historian, and helps avoid the pitfalls of false histories etc.It can also be used as a springboard by reading the works cited in each part so as to further an understanding of the Craft. For example, I'm currently reading Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, which is the book that Francis Barret ...create The Magus (which I have already read), and these together with Crowley's Magick (Book 4 & Magick in Theory and Practice, which is also well worth reading!) give a good basis for understanding the symbolism & reasons for certain ritual practice. By understanding the philosophy it also helps to create more effective ritual oneself (although I'm more spontaneous than planned ritual in general), and helps an understanding of the occult/esoteric/hidden laws of nature.I particularly agree with his comments that when Wicca was shown to be a modern development most people started to jump to ""Traditional Witchcraft"" etc, claiming it to be older in provinence, when it is blatantly obvious to anyone who has looked at the evidence that it has just as few roots in the past as Wicca.Triumph of the Moon, although historical in tone, is still sympathetic to Witchcraft & its practitioners, pointing out that it is a valid independent religion (and discussing why), not a cult, sect etc, that its modern origin makes it no less valid, & doesn't attempt to discuss whether spells, healing etc really work, only that people use it & there are cases in which the intended result seems to have occured.After reading it, although the romantic notion of an age old religion will be shown to be a fantasy (which deep down most people already suspected), and that it is a modern synthesis of older & new ideas, I for one found myself feeling better than ever about being a witch.",book
1634,"This book is widely criticized; it seems that it has hit a nerve with some Pagans who believe, or want to believe, that Gerald Gardner revealed to the public a religion which had survived in secret since the Stone Age. (The other night I attended a Pagan gathering, at which a locally respected elder insisted, angrily, that the Druids were practicing recognizable Wicca in the stoneworks of Newgrange.)However, this book dispelled a completely opposite illusion from my mind. I had long suspected that Gerald Gardner had been a ""dirty old man"", who used a cursory knowledge of ceremonial magic to create a religion whose sole purpose was to get young women to disrobe for him. And that it took the timely arrival of Doreen Valiente to turn Wicca into an actual religion rather than just Gardner's personal fetish party. Hutton bursts that bubble as neatly as he bursts the ""ancient survival"" theorists' bubble. I came away from this book with respect for both Gardner and Valiente, as well as several other prominent early Wiccans, and even a bit of bemused affection for Aleister Crowley.Hutton shows that Gardner wasn't passing on an ancient tradition, but also that he wasn't just making it up out of nowhere. He traces Wicca's roots back to Romantic literature (no wonder I like paganism! I love the poetry), Masonry, cunning craft, ceremonial magic, spiritualism, and other fields. At the time Wicca was presented to the public, certain factors made it precisely what made sense in the culture of the times. From there, Hutton follows Wicca to the present day, and the forces of politics and psychology that have resulted in the Wicca we see today. (And he even mentions Rae Beth, my favorite but somewhat obscure 101 author.)Through all of this history runs a current that I don't think I'm imagining. I could be wrong, but I feel that between the lines of this scholarly, intellectual text is a deep interest and fascination with Wicca. I can almost see, in some places, where the author's enthusiasm almost breaks through the cool, collected prose. To those who say Hutton is hostile toward Wicca, I think you've missed that undercurrent. It bears mentioning that Hutton took flak in the scholarly community for his sympathy toward the Wiccan religion.This is a mature, intelligent book about the origins and history of Wicca, and I believe it marks a rite of passage for the religion as a whole. This is, finally, a book we can hand to our curious friends, and say, ""This is where I'm coming from, this is what we're about"", without embarrassment. This book made me more proud to be a Pagan than I've been in a long time.",book
1635,"Ronald Huttons Triumph is all inclusive: From the 17th century start of initiatory secret societies in the form of Scottish Masonry; to the first use of the phrases: ""the craft, ""so mote it be,"" ""merry meet, merry part;"" to the origins of the meanings of the cardinal points of the compass and the four elements; to the origin of grimoires and the use of sacred tools such as the chalice, pentacle, athame and wand; to the reasons Gardner used nudity in ritual; to the inspiration for the charge of the goddess; almost all of the ""origin"" questions about Wicca are answered in this book.You will also learn about things you never expected: From 19th century naturalist authors who yearned to escape the industrialization of the day, to the many magicians who worked with High magic before Crowley was even born, to the naturalist clubs that sprouted up around the turn of the century including the ""Seton Indians,"" ""Boy Scouts,"" ""Order of Woodcraft Chilvalry,"" ""Kindred of the Kibbo Kift,"" and the ""Woodcraft Folk.""All the major players are here, the people, traditions and many early covens including the Rosicrucians, Theosophy, Barrett, Constant aka Levi, Mackenzie, Little, Hockley, Kingsford, Mathers, Sprengel, Blavatsky, Frazier, Gage, Leland, Crowley, Firth aka Fortune, Graves, Murray, Gardner and everyone worth noting that came on the scene after Gardner.I loved the interplay of the Gardenerians and non-Gardenerians during Wiccas ""formative years"" and of the claims and the debunking of the claims of all the people who came out of the woodwork with family trads after Garder made his ""splash"" onto the scene. It was particularly illuminating to have someone (Hutton) investigate most everyone who claimed to study or be initiated by Crowley by going back to Crowleys extensive day to day diary and see that that persons name didn't appear on the day in question or even weeks ahead or behind ""the day.""About Hutton's ""bias"" that so many here have commented on: I believe his Bias is ""the truth."" While he systematically debunks the claims of many in the early times by looking at facts, timelines or places, he treats everyone fairly especially Crowley, Gardner, Valiente and Cochrane. He refutes the claims of Crowley being a Satanist; going against the grain of the anti-Gardner backlash, he gives Gardner his due of inventing a genuine original modern religion; Valente as being the author of much of Wiccas wonderful poetry but at the same time tending to believe in ""evil"" craft purely from newspaper article evidence, and the firebrand Cochrane who despite alienating everyone in his later life, was able to lead rituals that ""genuinely swept up and transformed"" participants.Huttons tone throughout his work is always upbeat and never harsh or accusatory. The general feeling after finishing and reflecting on this work is that Hutton has tried to give modern Pagan witchcraft a more solid footing by addressing all of the troubling aspects of the craft (namely its history) by an apologist allowing the culture to come up with their own answers and come to terms with the colorful characters of their spirituality.",book
1636,"Prof. Hutton has done a thorough job of looking at the British part of the neopagan equation. There is little I can add to the many excellent reviews here, except to say that this book belongs on the bookshelf of every person interested in the roots of neopaganism, whether armchair occultist, practicing pagan, or nonpagan trying to understand the origins and growth of such paths as Wicca.For those who may be uncomfortable or disillusioned by the historical evidence, realize that _authenticity_ (the truth of a matter as a historical artifact) is not necessarily the same as _validity_ (the practical side of truth). Whether Neopaganism is a rebirth of an ancient truth or not, a tree is judged by the fruit it bears.",book
1637,"This is a veyr detailed and informative history. However the paperback edition has miniscule print on low grade paper, so much so that it is hard to read for a long period of time. I would reccomend getting the hardback. The work itself is great and it's worth paying the extra to be able to read it without needing aspirin on standby.",book
1638,"Whilst some may find Mr Huttons Writing style hard to follow, the material is none the less exceptional as well as directly relevant.",book
1639,"As a practicing Wiccan, this book has been a joy and a fascinating journey. Dr.Hutton has given the Neo-Pagan community a book that it has desperately needed for over 30 years. A sober, well documented account of the immediate roots of the 20th century neo-Pagan movement. He surveys the English romantic poets, German romanticism, British folk magic and the high ritual magic groups of the 19th century to provide primary documentation on the development of the emerging paganism. It is also a good antidote for those who claim that all modern occultism and the idea of Neo-Paganism started in the sixties as a hippy fad. We find here that ideas in witchcraft, Wicca and many New Age teachings go back well into the 18th century, and some to the Renaissance and the ancient world.The first part of the book,""Macrocosm"", is an overview of the period from 1800 to 1940. The first chapter sets the stage for this by discussing the four different views of pre-Christian and non-Christian religions that were held by various people during the nineteenth century. Here he traces the emerging interest in reviving pagan ideas, which was one of these views. The following chapters examine specific elements of the movement, like God, Goddess, high magic, folk magic, witchcraft, and folklore. The second half of the book, ""Microcosm"" examines specific people and events in the development of modern witchcraft during the 20th century. (...)It should be noted that this book does not give you spells or rituals. It is not a how-to book, but simply historic and cultural background. And it is written by someone who is not antagonistic towards Neo-Paganism. In the second chapter, Hutton declares that, although he is tracing the history of the idea of Goddess as taught by modern witches, this does not mean that a God and Goddess are simply ideas created by men. Indeed, he acknowledges that theological conclusions are outside the realm of a historian. He suggests that it is possible that the gods are simply reasserting themselves in people's consciousness.But even this suggestion is not one upon which a historian can make an authoritative pronouncment.There are only two small flaws to the book. First, Hutton could have added one more chapter giving some better background on Hermetic philosophy, tying it into neo-Platonic theory and Gnosticism. Wicca is, after all, a form of Hermetic magic, but one that uses pagan principles instead of Christian principles like the Masons or the Rosicrucians. (...) Also, I think Hutton gives too much credit to Gerald Gardner as the inventor of Wicca, whereas I strongly feel that Wicca was emerging for about 50 years before Gardner's involvement. But Hutton does say that this is only a history of modern pagan witchcraft, not ""The"" history. But for now, it is one of the best out there for the practitioner and layman alike. Wicca does have a legitimate history and it is even more fascinating then the tripe usually found in modern witchcraft books.",book

1641,"This is a wonderfully well reseached and scholarly book. If you are at all interested in the topic, it is a must read. Although it was very dry in parts, it was well worth studying. It clears away nearly all the cobwebs that surround the topic.",book
1642,This should be the first book anyone interested in wicca should read. It got me running to other books to cross reference facts and I've leaned so much while reading it. It's not too dry and was actually fairly easy to read compared to other academic books I've read.,book
1643,"To the Pagans of the modernist movement- those that believe the power of our faiths is the POWER of our faiths, not the revisionist history some tack on to it like gold ribbon on a white robe, we see here our vindication. We've been saying this for years, and if Hutton is WRONG, as some here have stated, surely someone can come along with source material and set him right.",book
1644,"The Triumph of the Moon, by Hutton,Hutton is a British historian who has spent 10 years or so researching pagan history. He recent book deals with the social and cultural forces that led to the emergence of Wicca in the middle of the 20th century. He then chronicles the major trends in Wicca in the last half of the 20th century. In one chapter he discusses the Starhawk/Budapest feminist California liberal misandrist turn that paganism took in the 1980s. Hutton describes how their badly misandrist and overly emotional writing lacked any scholarly credibility, but nevertheless had a major impact of Wicca and paganism in general for two decades. With publication of Hutton's book and others we are finally beginning to see some signs of returning to a more balanced pagan literature.His history is incomplete however, and he makes some of the same mistakes and assertions that he criticizes others for making. For example in the first half of the book Hutton extensively details literary references to witches and claims about historic roots. Many pages are each devoted to Margaret Murray and others. Then toward the end he waives off all of that in a page or two by simply asserting that it has been disproved. He provides nothing close to supporting data to demonstrate that claim. A few years ago I attended a workshop by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowikci (21 books and other publications listed on Amazon) where she described in detail her study of an actual pagan village that kept itself hidden since the Norman invasion, and which had written records of village life since that time. According to Nowicki the village was finally over run by urban sprawl in 1990 but most of the residents have relocated to a new hidden village that still follows pre-christian pagan traditions. Nowicki says that her mother was born in the pagan village. Either Nowicki was lying to everyone who has attended her workshops describing the pagan village, or Hutton's scholarship that ""disproved"" the survival of actual pagan villages is sadly lacking. I have also researched or become aware of several other pieces of information that leads me to believe 1) that some of the historical witch trials and hangings were in fact people whom modern pagans would recognize as pagan witches, and 2) that some family tradition witches were actually surviving pagan witches. Hutton asserts that all claims to any pagan survival have been disproved, and in fact are not possible, but he offers no proof and provides no data. A widely published author, Initiate Wiccan HPS, and leader of a Ceremonial Magick society in the UK such as Ashcroft-Nowicki cannot be waived off by assertion without some evidence that her claims are false. My own family admitted to being witches at the Salem trials, but their stories have been deleted from current histories rather than researched and discounted. You won't find their names on lists of witch trial victims published in the last half century. Today's historians would rather claim that all the witch trial victims were really Christians. That's not scholorship, that's just avoiding the disagreable facts.On the positive side Hutton does provide a lot of information about Gardner and subsequent Wiccan history. His observations about the state of Wicca today are interesting. I was especially fascinated by the discussion trying to fit Wicca into anyone's scholarly classification system for religions and religious branches. Wicca, it seems, doesn't fit any classification system and religious scholars don't know what even to call it. I would recommend the book to all Wiccans and interested parties, but keep in mind that it's not the last word on a lack of pagan roots.",book
1645,"This book was a very enjoyable read, partly for the quality of the writing style, partly for the way it catalogues so many interesting people, events and ideas, and partly for the thrill of the hunt as I tracked down and nailed mistake after mistake.In a work of this scope a few factual errors are to be expected, but the sheer number of these errors, and the immensity of some of his misrepresentations is staggering, especially from someone who claims to be unbiased, and to have not left any significant silences.Hutton's scholarly yet entertaining tone has starstruck a generation of pagans who previously had seen nothing better than Llewellyn's books (note all the 5-star reviews), however, his scholarship is full of big, black, holes.The main thrust of the book is to destroy any possibility of any kind of history or continuity to pre-Gardnerian ""Wicca"" or witchcraft. This is fine up to a point, but in his anti-Murray-ist zeal he goes so far as to conclude that not one single practitioner of any kind of pagan religion was persecuted in Europe during the time of the witch trials (1400-1700).To support this extreme claim he employs character assassination against such people as Gardner and Leland (supported on a series of shaky or downright wrong information), quotes other authors very selectively or out of context, paints quite unrealistic pictures of historical folk-magic (for instance, describing English cunning folk as isolated and having little or no contact with each other, and getting all their skills by mail order from London, when contemporary accounts describe that in some areas there were as many cunning-folk as parish priests).He criticises the eminent scholar and historian Carlo Ginzburg (certainly a more rigorous scholar than Hutton) of supporting Margaret Murray, but seems to have either not read, or somehow not understood Ginzburg's books which he has quoted from. He even at one point gives a list of authors who supposedly agree with him that no condemned ""witches"" held pagan religious beliefs - however if you actually read these authors, you will find that only one or two of them make any such claim, and in fact about half of them seem to take quite the opposite view, suggesting all kinds of connections with pre-christian religion (and giving lots of evidence in support).Hutton doesn't even attempt to address the wealth of previous work that has gone into understanding the pre-christian religions of Europe and their continuation through folk-lore and custom. Folklorists like Jacob Grimm may have written some years ago when different academic approaches were in vogue, but this doesn't give Hutton license to entirely ignore their seminal works. There is an enormously different picture to be painted if you read just the authors Hutton has cited, let alone if you expand into wider areas such as folklore and legislation.I really did enjoy reading this book, and I see it offering a good starting point for other better-prepared researchers, providing as it does such a nice catalogue of people and ideas (also, research is more fun when you have a contentious point or two to argue over). However as a book to be read and believed by Wiccans and pagans it is a tragedy. Instead of tracing the development of modern Wicca and witchcraft in a fair light, he stamps on these thin tenuous roots and casts a blackening smokescreen across what is already a dim enough area of history.UPDATE: After writing this review way back in 2002 I continued reading Hutton's references and retracing his steps, and uncovered further extensive errors. While the history he provides from the 1950s onwards is mostly pretty good, his treatments of previous periods, all the way back to prehistory, are out of step with common scholarly consensus, and potentially highly misleading. I have now published a full-length critique:Trials of the Moon: Reopening the Case for Historical Witchcraft.",book
1646,"I would not necessarily disagree with any particular point Hutton makes. Much of what he states is nearly self-evident rather than surprising to any individual who is well read in the area of Modern Paganism, but the number of resources he has brought together make this book worth reading simply as a reference. It is an excellent who's who of occult figures providing ample information on possible biases they may have. It also successfully catalogs and presents many of the arguments about the origins of Modern Witchcraft. That said his theories aren't truly proven and his writing often falls just short of providing the details that would even allow one to truly judge his inferences, suppositions and the conclusions. He too is guilty of many of the literary failings of which he accuses his subjects. Unproven though his theories, inferences, suppositions and conclusions may be they do provide ample food for thought and are certainly worth considering. ""Triumph of the Moon"" is a very slow read, but worth plodding through.",book
1647,"Amazing book tracing the evolution of the neopagan movement and a must read for intelligent people who are interested in the Wiccan religion. It may disillusion some of us who are laboring under the belief that we are ""hereditary witches"" or that modern witchcraft has a unified and unbroken heritage that extends back into pre-history. But for the truly dedicated Wiccan who has a hunger to understand and follow the historical threads, this is the book to read. If you still want to pursue Magic of any sort after you finish this book, then you will embrace the Call as a well-informed practitioner rather than just a game-player or poser.",book
1648,"Having given up in defeat after attempting to wander through other alleged &quot;histories of modern Wicca&quot; that turned out to be nothing more than the author's pet fantasies, I asked a well-known Wiccan author and teacher what would be her recommendation. She recommended this book. She wasn't wrong.This book is every bit as good as the positive reviewers say it is, so I won't comment in that area. What I fail to understand is the vehemence of this book's critics, especially those who seem fixated on defending their favorite authors. Hutton is not terribly kind to some authors, yes. But the negative reactions seem to indicate that some people take the words of those authors as a kind of &quot;gospel.&quot; Is that wise?What I do find fascinating is that even though some of the great sacred cows of Wicca/Paganism are done away with, other, even more surprising facts raise their heads. Why is it, for example that even in the most repressive of times, the Goddess will not be effaced? If She will not be worshiped in the churches, then She appears to the poets of the Romantic era. A country cleric, for no good reason, becomes infatuated with Pan and erects a statue to Him in front of a church, simply based on a mis-hearing of the shouting of a group of villagers. There are many such oddities scattered throughout the book. Doesn't it strike anyone else as very odd that the Old Gods and Goddesses keep manifesting themselves, in multitudes of ways, no matter what?The histories of the &quot;major occultists,&quot; are interesting, but behind Hutton's exploration of the lives of people like Graves, Gardner, Crowley, Dion Fortune, Mathers, et. al., there is a subtle running stream of continuity. The Old Gods manifest throughout Hutton's history; not in the traditional common ways that many Wiccans and Pagans were taught, but in even more mysterious glimpses, working through historical figures who have otherwise been forgotten, dropping hints and ideas in old books that somehow magically are picked up by the right person at the right time and read...Perhaps in this book some of our Wiccan and Pagan idols are knocked off their pedestals. Some survive the fall and some do not. But if you look behind all this remarkable scholarship and read the facts that Hutton has put here, you find an astonishing record of how the Old Gods, working behind the scenes, continue to manifest themselves by any means necessary.Is this too religious a view of this book? Probably. I'm sure Hutton's intent was never to show such things. But he has, will he or nil he. It's there to be seen.",book
1649,"This type of accurate scholarly work is so needed in the pagan community these days. Wicca, which is never to be confused with witchcraft, has it's interesting inception unveiled here. Seems like an English nudist and former civil servant wanted to create a new religion. And to do so he used some already existing sources, and heavily edited others. Pretty impressive to create a new religion; so I give Gerald and his folks their due. I find it sad that his creativity cannot be applauded. Instead, some wiccans feel that validity is only to be found in being the one true and authentic remnant of the ""old religion"". This is an important book in helping the new age community and the xtian fundamentalists finally ""get it right"" with their terminology. Witches do not practice wicca; wiccans do. Maybe in a future book the author can explore where those two terms try to meet in the new reconstructuralist pagan traditions.",book
1650,"This book gives a clear, convincing history of the development of the 'religion' of witchcraft, showing quite clearly that the movement is 20th century in origin, and that extravagant claims about the antiquitiy of the religion have no basis in reality. Mr hutton shows that claims about the ancient origins of the witchcraft religion are nonsense, but he is always kind and polite, and never ridicules the beliefs of modern wiccans, he must be the world's most tactful historian. An earlier review of this book claims to have attended a workshop by someone who says she knows of a 'hidden' Pagan village in England, dating back to before the Norman conquest and only discovered in the 1990s. I don't think this reviewer can ever have been to England. We are a very small country, with 9as P.J. O'Rourke puts it)'A population density like Macy's toy department at Christmas'. There aren't any hidden Pagan villages here because there's nowhere to hide them, okay?",book
1651,"A lot of books on Pagan history have proven to be long on &quot;wishcraft&quot; and short on historical accuracy or scholarship. Origins of Modern Witchcraft by Ann Moura is a very recent (and perfect) example of this.Ronald Hutton's Triumph of the Moon - a History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, however, is a very different matter. It is a meticulously researched, however tentative, history of the NeoPagan movement, with a thorough bibliographical section to direct the reader to further study and research. He describes Wicca, or as he calls it Pagan Witchcraft, as an Old Religion/New Religion, uniquely English and European in origin, with many of its key elements and concepts coming straight out of the Romantic Era, particulary its poetry, and others coming from truly ancient sources.Hutton is not Pagan (he is a Professor of History at the University of Bristol), yet he definately considers the NeoPagan movement worthy of more research and study, especially because, as he writes, &quot;it is the only religion which England has ever given the world&quot; While he is often quite critical in his examination of the major players in the development of the Pagan novement (i.e Gerald Gardner, Aelister Crowley, Margaret Murray) and refutes many Wiccan claims regarding the supposedly ancient origins of modern Wicca, he leaves no doubt at the end that Paganisn has evolved into a coherent social and religious movement, one that has moved far beyond what Gardener could ever have imagined,He concludes, &quot;Pagan witchcraft qualifies as a full-blown, independent religion. It is more than a shared set of stories, language, or images, and more than a common store of deities and texts. It has a common identity and a common institutional structure, of the coven supplemented by solitary practice of the same tradition. It is more than the veneration of a single diety or object, and has not seperated off from a larger religious body or movement.&quot; Hardly news to Pagans, but something that many Christian and secular critics of Paganism in the U.S. - including President Bush - have yet to discover.Triumph of the Moon sets a new standard for historical research into Paganism's origins and its potential contributions to the world. It also serves as a call and challenge for more research. I recommend it most highly to both Pagan and non-Pagan readers.",book
1652,"OK, it's a cliche, but it's true: if you only ever read one book on Wicca and modern neo-paganism, read this one! It will dissuade even the most hardcore Wiccan of the idea that Wicca is anything other than a purely modern invention. Although that doesn't invalidate it as a religion per se, it does demolish the myth that Wiccans are following an ancient religion that existed prior to the coming of Christianity.",book
1653,"I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!",book
1654,"I checked this book out from my local public library. The information contained within is generally good. There are nuggets of valuable information that helped me come up to speed on the domain of using a handgun for personal defense.This book will fit the bill for newcomers to handguns and existing pistol owners who want to learn how to prepare themselves for personal defense. Novices to firearms of all kinds may start out a little confused. This is not a Handguns for Dummies type book.The wound potential, cartridge info and the drills were especially of interest to me.The writing leaves a lot to be desired. This book would have been better if the author had hired a polished editor. I often had to read sentences multiple times in order to understand them because of the way they were worded. There were several typos, which eventually lead you to think the book was rushed to market without any editor at all.Another problem is that the photos inserted are rarely mentioned in the text. Normally, photos are added to books to aid in the understanding of the text. Those in this book are supplemental, but not referenced, so they feel like afterthoughts, pasted in after the text was all written.The chapter on cartridges (i.e. calibers) would have been much better if each caliber that was described had a nice close-up photo next to a coin for size reference. The stance photos are too small and not close up enough to identify the important elements that distinguish one from another (Weaver vs horse vs Isosceles).Yet another problem is the use of jargon without including some kind of glossary or footnotes to explain them. If you don't already hang out with others at the shooting range, some of the jargon will go right past you. Cliches like ""...will carry the day"" are overused, tiresome and pretentious.Lastly, I was disappointed with the lack of attention paid to concealed carry. With the title ""The Handgun in Personal Defense"", you'd think there would be a whole chapter on gun sizes (frame height, grip width, barrel length), holster locations and even the laws for CC. But there was very little information provided.The top 50 fighting handguns was a good chapter, but the author doesn't explain the order in which they are presented. He also admits that if he couldn't get his hands on it, he didn't include it. Admirable, but a list of good reputable albeit personally untested guns would not have gone amiss. I'm sure there are dozens of experienced folks who read this and wonder ""What about the Blarg D40? I've had that gun for years and it's my favorite!""If you can ignore the very average writing and look for the nuggets of information contained within, you'll get something out of this book. It's worth one read through. For me, I'm glad I checked it out for free and didn't plunk down the $15 MSRP. If I ever find it used for under $7, I'll probably go ahead and buy it.",book

1657,"i was looking for a way to introduce the concept of death to my children prior to suffering an actual loss. The simplicity and elegance of this book moved me deeply. because i was not trying to address a specific type of loss, such as family or a pet, i appreciate the manner in which all life is discussed. the beauty with which it normalizes the cycle of life and death is extraordinary. i feel so grateful for having found this book.",book
1658,"This is an excellent, matter-of-fact introduction to life and death. I even learned a couple things!It's probably a little early (my boy is only 1.5 years), but I wanted to try to get this topic (among others) out in the open from an early age. I guess I just figured that if the discussion was normal now, then it would be so much easier for him when he does have to deal with the death of our cat, or a grandparent, or anyone or -thing else.The book came in the mail last week so, before work, I sat down to give it a read. This book does do a wonderful job explaining how every life has a beginning and end, and how different lifetimes apply to different living things. It does say something along the lines of ""that may be sad"" to quickly address feelings, but it doesn't harp on feelings.I'm really glad I purchased the book. As mentioned, it leaves out the emotional bit, so there's still some explaining to do when the time comes.",book

1660,We bought this book for our then 2 years old daughter after our son was stillborn. It's a very simple book that shows that death is natural and happens to every living being.

1662,"This is a book I give to any student teacher who comes to my classroom as a parting gift. It is a gift any teacher should have if they teach young students.

1665,My four year old liked this book. Not a ton of action so he only wanted to read it a few times but it was a great introduction to death when our dog died. It doesn't talk about heaven or anything religeous - just a matter of fact book about how everything living dies and it's a part of how the world works.,book

1670,"This is on our recommended list, too -- a good way to explain loss to children.Again, I am nonplussed by the prices listed by various booksellers. Is this a scam? This book is still in print and available in paperback for $12.00 to $14.00 new.",book
1671,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe.",book
1672,"I have a fairly extensive collection of books about death and grieving for ""my"" children, which we have used for the loss offamily, friends and pets. But this is the only book I regularly give copies of to families. The ""de-personalized"" way it talks about death, the universality of its text combined with soft drawings and repetition are very soothing. This is NOT a book about emotions or stages of death. (If you are looking for one of those Everett Anderson's Goodbye is a positive place to start.)This is a book about the rhythm of life and death for all creatures, for everything that is born. One of the best parts of the book is its emphasis on what a lifetime is, and how it is framed by birth and death, and that inbetween those ""markers"" is what is important. It explains that different creatures have different life spans, and that this aspect of nature is neither fair nor unfair. It simply is.I do not restrict this book to times when a child is grieving,I include it in our regular reading rotation, so that the children see death as a normal part of life experiences. Death is so emotionally charged, especially for the grown ups, that having a calm book is especially worthwhile. When a child is actually grieving balancing the more ""intense"" books with this soothing one, does wonders.",book
1673,"After losing my wife (33 years old) two years ago, this was one of the books that was recommended to me .... and I am glad I took the recommendation. This is a GREAT book for explaining the subject of lifetimes to children, especially in the 3-5 year old range.What is great about this book and something I didn't realize at the time was that lifetimes didn't have to only related to death of people. EVERYTHING has a lifetime and it has helped my daughter in many ways. A couple months ago, when my daughter's balloon popped and she was very sad, she said ""Dad, I guess my balloon's lifetime is over"", and then she went to throw it away. She was sad but understood the concept that all things, living and unliving, have a lifetime. We still use the concepts today on a regular basis, and she still likes to read the book as well.HIGHLY recommended, even for those children that haven't had to deal with true loss or death yet ... at least in my opinion.",book
1674,"I heard about this book and decided to take a look before I needed it. I know that eventually my child will start asking questions about death, and I'd like to know what resources are available. I was particularly drawn to this title because it can be tailored to a variety of religious belief systems. I disagree with a previous poster who stated that this book teaches that there is no afterlife. The way I read it, the book doesn't take a stand either way. Being ""alive"" on earth is not the same thing as ""eternal life"" in the religions I am familiar with. No religion I know of denies that earthly bodies are alive and then they die.I like the fact that this book compares all types of organisms from plants to animals to people. The concept of a life span ties it all together. What is ""in between"" the beginning and ending of a life is living. I appreciate that this book emphasizes the in between, and therefore strikes a positive note.I would caution against using this book as a regular picture book for toddlers and older preschoolers because it may actually introduce the idea of death before a child is able to comprehend the explanation. However, I think it's an excellent choice for a child who is asking about death or who has recently experienced the loss of a pet, friend, or relative.",book
1675,"This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her ""dying day"" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying.",book
1676,This book is wonderful for small children. I purchased it for my children (ages 7 and 5) when we found out that their great grandmother was dying. It is very nicely illustrated and does not have any particular biblical beliefs that might be confussing to a child. It just explains that things begin and things end and the in between part is life. My children love this book,book
1677,"I looked around for a book to help my wife and I discuss the concept of death with our 2 year old when his grandma passed away recently. Most of the books in the kid section were way too advanced. This is the only one I found that I was comfortable even trying to read to him. After a few reads he seemed to have a good understanding of the book.However the book could be improved in a couple of ways. First the cadence of the writing and starting a thought on one page and finishing it on the next can make it awkward to read, especially if you read slowly and talk about the illustrations. Secondly there is an injured butterfly shown early in the book who has died. But later on there is a healthy butterfly shown - this confuses my child as he thinks the butterfly got better. This undermines the message of the first butterfly, that sometimes things get so badly hurt that they cannot be repaired.",book
1678,"Knowing and working with many young children, I have come to appreciate that there are certain concepts that we, as adults, tend to take for granted as being somehow obvious or, if you will, self-evident. One of these is the inevitability of death. Trying to explain death to a child - particularly to a very young ( 2 - 4 year old) child can be an exasperating experience for even the most well meaning parent, teacher or concerned adult. Luckily, there is a growing body of literature, written to be looked at while being read to youngsters that simplify the essential concept sown to a level that can be understood by the child and will suffice until the child lets us know, through their ever more sophisticated questions, that they need more information. I have a collection of such books that I use and recommend to parents, where death has been a recent event in the family, for use with their children. This book by Bryan Mellonie and Robert Ingpen, is the one I most frequently recommend for use with this youngest group of children.Each page contains a minimum of words with an illustration on the facing page - of which there are only about 20. Immediately, by design, the most common adult well-intentioned error is defeated: that involving giving into the propensity to talk TOO MUCH; to use TOO MANY WORDS; to try to explain the idea in a way that the young child is no where near ready to grasp yet. The initial page and illustration present an exemplary example. On the right side is a simple, hand-drawn illustration of a bird's nest containing two eggs. On the facing (left side) page, the following is the entirety of the text:There is a beginningAnd there is an ending for everythingThat is alive.In between is living.The rest of the text and illustrations bring this same basic idea home to kids via references all manner of living things. Sea creatures, plants, people, birds, trees and insects among them. On the fourth page across from a drawing of a crab:Nothing that is aliveGoes on living forever.How long it lives depends uponWhat it is and what happensWhile it is living.The next-to-last page:So, no matter how long they are,Or how short, lifetimes are reallyAll the same.They have beginnings, and endings,And there is living in between.Young children cannot be expected to understand death as we adults do - or believe we do. The decomposition of bodies, the questions of life-after-death, issues involving illness and disease: all of these are beyond the scope of conceptual understanding of the average pre-schooler. Keep it simple until more complex questions are forthcoming from the child. This book is a good first step in what is apt to be a prolonged, increasingly complex process.If sadness should befall your family (or a pet, or a friend, etc.) and you have a pre-schooler , take a look at this book and ask yourself if it might not be a good place to begin explaining things to YOUR child. I would certainly use it for mine.",book
1679,"After introducing the subject of death with ""Remember the Butterflies,"" I answered my daughter's question, ""What does 'die' mean?"" with this book. Unlike the other books we read to process her grandfather's death, she never wanted this one again, but it was very useful for answering that question. Its repeated message that everything alive dies, I think, gently but firmly leads to acceptance of this sad truth.",book
1680,"I purchased this book for my 5 year old daughter based on the previous reviews. Although we have not had a recent death in the family she was struggling with the fear of death to come. This book helped calm her fears and gave her a different way to look at dying by introducing the idea of ""lifetimes"" of all things, not just people. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs help explaining death. It was a great help.",book
1681,"I've used this book twice to explain death to my 5 year old son, once for a pet and second for a family member. This book is very well written and easy for a child to understand. It was recommended by my childs teacher.",book
1682,"This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss.",book
1683,"As advertised - great pictures, nice text, very use-able especially with pre-school kids -",book
1684,"This is a really great book to get for children and to read to children. It explains life from birth to death on a level kids can relate to. When you are at a loss for words trying to figure out how to make a child understand, you need to read this book .",book

1686,"We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising.",book
1687,"Our family loves this book. I bought it for the 1st time 41/2 years ago when I lost my dad to cancer. My daughter was almost 3. It explains death in a way young children can understand. Just recently I purchased this book for my friend's children that lost their beautiful, young mom to lymphoma.",book
1688,"This is a good book in many ways, but with a few issues that may prevent me from sharing it with my children.I like the straight-forward unsentimental approach to the topic. However at one point it states that people live for ""sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more."" As another reviewer noted, ""That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health."" It's also a bit off the mark, given that life expectancy in the US is close to 80, so 70 or 80 years might be more accurate...but I would have avoided putting a number on it myself.I also agree with other reviewers that the picture of the dead butterfly, followed by one of a live butterfly of the same species is confusing. And, finally, the splinter-removal picture is kind of scary and the child has a haunted look on his face.I recommend the book ""In a Nutshell,"" by Joseph Anthony.",book
1689,"I really liked this for my 2.5-3.5 year old boy. It's hard to find a non-religious/heaven/God book on death that isn't too ""adult"". I like the repetition and the pictures especially. I feel like I actually get some comfort and understand about life (and death) from it myself ;)",book
1690,"Very simply, with few words, this book explains that there is a beginning and an end. In the middle is life. Beginnings and endings are going on around us all the time. For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point.",book
1691,"As a public school librarian, I would say that ""Lifetimes"" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: ""Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever."" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that ""Lifetimes"" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.",book
1692,"This is a wonderful book that helps explain death and loss to young children. It's good for ages 4 - 8. It gently explains that all things that are alive begin and end, inbetween is living. No mention of life after death, no religious overtones. ""No matter how long or short they are this is their lifetime"". This is a must have for all households with young children.",book
1693,"My Grandmother died on May 27th and since then my son who is just shy of 4 has been asking so many questions. We've always used books as a tool for our discussions to help us explain things to him. I bought several books and even though they were good, this book was just the perfect fit for a 4 year old. It's matter of fact, simple to understand- no hidden meanings or euphemisms. Now when he asks why a bug died we can say, ""That was HIS lifetime"" or when he gets upset and asks when our cat is going to die we can say, ""He's still living in-between"" and he just gets it. I run an assisted living facility and am ordering it for my resource library so that the resident's families can borrow it if necessary.",book

I have to say that the book was good at helping me understand death, but that the picture of the little boy with the splinter haunted me for years.

1696,"Marian Wright Edelman, in pleasing prose, shares the experiences she had growing up surrounded by a community of mentors, both formal and informal. Edleman talks about the importance of parents, community elders as co-parents and mentors, and the powerful role teachers can play in the development of character. Her college years were greatly influenced by the civil rights leaders of the time, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Robert Kennedy among others. Edelman shares lessons learned from influential faculty and family friends and helps readers understand what it is like to be a part of something larger than themselves.This book, which focuses on the powerful influence that mentors can have on children and young adults, finishes with Edelman's ""Parent's Pledge"" and ""Twenty-Five More Lessons for Life"". She shares the wisdom gained from her parents and elders as well as her many years of experience working with children. Pearls such as ""Always remember you are God's child. No man or woman can look down on you and you cannot look down on any man or woman or child"" and ""Keep your word and your commitments"" provide valuable advice for those seeking a strong moral center. This book is a recommended read for anyone interested in life lessons learned from a woman of faith whose experiences have been enriched by her interactions with the mentors in her life.",book
1697,"For centuries sailors have relied on the constellations of heavenly lanterns to guide their way. In crisp, vivid prose, Marian Wright Edelman tells us about the heroes who provided beacons of hope and inspiration, helping her find her way through the many moral dillemas of life and stay on course.What is interesting is the sheer variety of backgrounds Dr. Edelman's heroes have. Nevertheless, they all share the author's passion for human rights and social justice. As a bonus, Dr. Edelman gives a brief history of the civil rights era, a nice complement to two other fine books on that fascinating topic, Taylor Branch's &quot;Parting the Waters&quot; and David Halberstam's &quot;The Children.&quot;This book is much more a memoir. It is a call of action and an inspiration for all of us to act for the common good, to serve the community. It is up to the current generations to act as a positive role model for the next, much as Dr. Edelman's mentors did for her.Mentors, lanterns, are important at all times, during the economic boom of the late 1990s, when this book was written, as well as in the troubled initial years of the 21st century. There are already too many ships out there lacking a sailor to read the stars. And some ships don't even have a rudder.",book

1702,"When the government robs Peter in order to pay Paul, they have to pay for the entire process of robbing: constructing laws, buying the guns, hiring more bureaucrats, etc. In other words, when government spends funds to redistribute income, they divert resources that could be used on more productive activities.&quot;The Transfer Society&quot; is a slim but marvelous study on how much the government spends each year on enforcing the coercive transfer of money from one party to another. You may think that these forced transfers do not cost very much money -- and if one takes each transfer at a time, he may be right. But taken as a whole, multiplied by the government's long reaching tenacles, they estimate that the government spends $400B redistributing.But if that was not enough, Laband and McClintock go on to demosntrate that this projected $400B is in reality an understatement; they cannot estimate the preemptive measures taken by individuals to protect their property from the government. For example, if the government used eminent domain to seize somebody's land, L&amp;M's model would not account for the costs of one hiring a lawyer to protect himself from coercive government. Forced transfers, thus, waste a staggering amount of money that would be better used in productive activity.This book is a timely economic complement to the moral argument against forced expropriation. The magnitude of the problem is exposed so convincingly that it should become a focus of attention for quite some time.",book
1703,"This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer.",book
1704,"How much time, money and resources have been allotted to influence how wealth is distributed in this country? Over $2,000 year for every individual, according to this title. The figure doesn't represent the amount transferred, but the amount spent on influencing transfers. Transfer Society provides a refreshingly different perspective on new wealth and the process of distributing wealth within the government and private sectors. Intriguing and different.",book
1705,"Not as well known as some of his contemporaries, Robert Lyons deserves a wider audience. Having previously published two other books on Africa, with Intimate Enemy he has published his most mature work. Composed of mostly square format black and white portraits, the book is spare simple and without judgement.. It shows again how the larger forces of history and politics can make the best of people do the worst of things. Not an easy book to look at but well worth having.",book
1706,"Robert Lyons and Scott Straus, Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices from the Rwandan Genocide (Zone, 2006)By now, pretty much every one is aware of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, almost invisible while it was going on but the subject of a great deal of media exposure since. As with all such things, though, there's always another angle from which to approach it. Robert Lyons and Scott Straus find one (two, actually) with Intimate Enemy; show the genocide from the point of view of those who participated (in Lyons' case), or from every point of view there is to be had in Rwanda (in Straus').After two introductions in which the author and photographer explain their methodologies in collecting the material presented here, we get into the edited transcripts of a number of interviews Lyons did with genocidaires-- those convicted of genocidal behavior who freely confessed to their crimes. Simply put, they're fascinating. Reading them, one has to wonder how much of what's said needs to be taken with how much salt; there's a lot of language that sounds suspiciously like ""I was only following orders,"" but with a dash of ""if I hadn't, I'd have been just as dead"" added to it. Straus' photographs, presented with no context whatsoever (notes on the photos are presented in a separate section afterwards), are even more intriguing, since he juxtaposes mass murderers with innocent bystanders, judges, victims' families. (Despite what you read in some of the interviews, you won't be able to tell them apart.)Thought-provoking. Recommended. ***",book
1707,"This very illuminating book shows us, through the descriptions of participants, what it was like during the Rwanda genocide. Photographic portraits made later show us other participants. Together they make a picture of yet another holocaust.The analysis of political scientist Scott Straus and the photographs of Robert Lyons exemplify the belief that objectivity is the key to understanding human affairs, social science. With it there is the hope that dispassionate, systematic analysis, like in the physical sciences, will provide understanding of and divergence from the destructive courses of the past. Straus uses the random sample; Lyons the straight-on shot. By striping away context, there is the promise that essences will be revealed. If Straus and Lyons had been able to observe the killings, instead of asking questions third hand, instead of photographing after the fact, would we better understand why people kill people? Terrorist videos with their fixed focus views are the closest we have to being present at horror. Yet when that wildly passionate, unprofessional radio announcer at the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937 says ""This is terrible', we understand. But what kind of understanding is that?Bill Arnold BA political science, MFA photography",book
1708,"Aaron Sisson, a coal miner and amateur flutist in the Midlands, abandons his wife and two children and escapes to Italy in the hope of throwing off the trammels of his environment and realising his individual potentials. His dream is to become recognised as a master flutist. In Florence, he mixes in intellectual and artistic circles and has an affair with an aristocratic lady who redeems him in his own eyes. Like the majority of Lawrence's novels, the central theme is the relations between men and women, though this time, it is given a twist owing to Lawrence nourishing his mind on a reading of Nietzsche, who was then gradually becoming recognised in England. In his analysis of the concept of &quot;love&quot; between the sexes, Lawrence perceives it as a function of the will to power, a cycle of reciprocal domination and surrender, in which the man must conquer and the woman must submit. Elements of the rejection of the &quot;herd morality&quot; on Aaron's part and his endeavour at self-development are both ideas of peculiarly Nietzschean provenance. The fact that Aaron realises himself through music is another echo of Nietzsche, who regarded music as the purest and most supreme of the arts, in which the passions achieve immense gratification. The title refers to the rod of Aaron in the Old Testament, one of Moses's renegade priests who built the golden calf in the desert for the worship of the Israelites. The rod, his symbol of authority and independence, finds its echo in Aaron's flute, which is broken later in the novel during an anarchist riot. There is a price to pay, Lawrence seems to imply, for daring to oppose orthodoxy and to try to create a new life for oneself. Unlike Lawrence's more famous works, such as &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot;, which are both admirable for their rich, poetic prose, &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot; is drably written and occasionally tedious, with a narrative that is sometimes poorly connected, as it dwells on irrelevancies. However, the message, that of an individual fulfilling his duty to himself, is an encouraging and refreshing one.",book
1709,"Strangely, this was my first full-length D.H. Lawrence novel. Thankfully, I'd read enough of his short stories and essays to know that Aaron's Rod isn't indicative of his artistic capabilities. I was more impressed by the concept behind the novel than its execution. Essentially, Aaron Sisson's abandonment of his family and job in order to join a travelling orchestra is meant to symbolize the power and passion of &quot;individual freedom,&quot; &quot;personal friendship&quot;, &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;art&quot;. I think he only half-succeeds. Just as Aaron comes across as an &quot;incomplete&quot; man searching for meaning in post World War I Europe, I think the novel is too loosely constructed, and Lawrence's characters, too thinly drawn. But on a symbolic level, they are full of Lawrentian psychology. The characters of Rawden Lilly, Struthers, the Bricknells, and others all overtly represent various aspects of male and female polarities; however, they are un-memorable and sometimes difficult to relate to.I was hoping this would be more of an &quot;artist's novel&quot; containing interesting descriptions of Aaron's life in Florence with his bohemian friends, and to a certain extent it is, but Lawrence seemed more interested in symbolism than in telling a good story. Though scattered as a story, the concepts of individuality and society are clearly portrayed throughout &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot;, and towards the end, when the anarchist's bomb goes off, we sense a &quot;breaking&quot; (the blue ball/ornament at the beginning, and the flute/rod at the end) of an outdated mode of thinking (i.e. patriarchy, male dominance, etc.) in favor not necessarily of feminity, but an integration of the two. This particular Penguin edition has an excellent introduction and helpful end-notes by Steven Vine which help explain Lawrence and his symbolism to those unfamiliar with his works. I might re-read this novel once I've read more of Lawrence, and come back to it one day from a different viewpoint, but for now, I'd have to say that unless you're a real Lawrence afficionado, I'd hold off on this one until you figure out whether or not you like Lawrence enough to proceed to something as scattered, cold, and dry as this novel comes across.",book
1710,With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete.

I wish someone would have warned me about this.,book
1711,"I'm not going to waste anyone's time by spouting the virtues of this book, other than it is one of those that gets better with each successive read and only makes you want to know more about Lawrence, since a lot of it is autobiographical.

It might really be insubstantial if not for the quality of Lawrence's prose.Now, for this Public Domain edition (at a not so bargain price). Mmmmmm, let's see...about 12 missing pages (that's right, completely missing), pages that look like they were copied by a 3 year old, or an 87 year old lush librarian --- smudgy, misshapen words, etc. Hey, I know this work is in the public domain....that's no excuse to grab some piece of deteriorating crap off the shelf, copy it and then attempt to profit by duping people that what they're getting is a quality product.It's not like there aren't better, complete versions out there...THEY'RE ON THE WEB!!!This edition is lazy, a travesty, and should be banned from being sold by Amazon as fradulent advertising.",book

1720,"Reading this book one encounters some information about pagan male deities, but it is presented in a manner ""dry"" and somewhat disorganized, just a collection of facts which seem to have been taken out of an encyclopedia, like a kid's homework. A more ""humane"" depiction of the God of the witches, is to be found in starhawk's spiral dance, it is inspired, poetic and it helps the practitioner to understand better, and attune to the horned God.Even though some of the rituals presented in this book are of interest I only gave it one star because in the section appertaining ""the war God"", the authors have the ridiculous arrogance of retiring the God mars! and even write: ""But war Gods today we can do without"" and ""we would do well to reject firmly mars"", so according to this people, people from the aries sign, (such as myself), the holy sephira Gebura,( which despite their folly is holy) and those born under the influence of the ""red ray"" should not exist! For a practitioner, to think that he/she is wiser than deity, is the first step in the path of self destruction, one shouldn't forget the story of Lucifer, although I'am a witch,there is always wisdom to be found in the theology and parables of other religions.Having seen that woman in a video (Janet Farrar) and observing her demeanor, it is not difficult to realize that she probably thinks she can tell the Gods what to do and even retire them!Their anti-war position of this people is an impracticable utopia, a dangerous delusion which is only likely to create imbalance in the microcosm and in the macrocosm and render the practitioner vulnerable to forces darker than he can possibly imagine.",book
1721,"This book is advertised as having three parts. The first discusses God archetypes, the second presents rituals for various Gods, and the third is supposed to be an encyclopedia of Gods. The only truely useful part (for me at least) is part one.The discussion of God archetypes is pretty good. Some of the archetypes are better than others, but overall the Farrars' do a good job of presenting the material. A little more academic than most of the other books I have read on the subject. Presents the each archetype seperately but makes important connections between them. Written sort of as a series of justifications for archetypes.The second part gives short descriptions of each God and then provides a ritual. Many of the rituals are little more than long incantations. They are all written for covens and most cannot be easily adapted to solitary use. Still, the descriptions of the Gods themselves are interesting.Finally the third part is nothing more than a list of names. Many of the names say nothing next to them at all. Some of three or four word descriptions like &quot;God of War&quot; or &quot;Father of Blank.&quot; Arranged alphabetically instead of by culture or archetype so you need to know the God's name in order to look it up, at which point you only learn His name, something you already knew.A good read if you are interested in learning more about the roles of God archetypes.",book
1722,"I love this book, yes, as a Wiccan, there are not a lot of books written about the God, but there are some, and this is by far the best. It has stories, tells you whos who and what's what. if you are a Wiccan, you need this book. Yes, I came into the Craft because the Goddess spoke to me as a woman, but the God has been masked and his many guises denied or branded evil. This book sets it straight. Please get your hands on a copy if you are Wiccan or wish to adore the many faces of God.",book

I have read several books by the Farrars and I would recommend most of them for the novice pagan.",book
1725,"I was surprised to find this book, essentially, &quot;light reading&quot;. I'm used to such a level of depth and scholarship from the Farrars that I was surprised they did not go into more detail in places.Still, they handled an incredibly broad subject extremely well, and the reference-list in the back -- with hundreds of God-names, telling what culture they're from &amp; giving a brief description -- is invaluable and unlike anything else I've run across. This section alone should earn it a space on every Wiccan's bookshelf.I plan to buy the companion book (The Witch's Goddess) when I have a chance.",book
1726,All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!,book
1727,"This is a fabulous, necessary book. How many books do we have that look at the sacred male sexuality? It is just a bonus that it was written by the Farrars. As usual, they have given the pagan community another reference book that doubles as an inspiration as well.",book
1728,"This book is well worth the time and effort. Our male divinites are a vital part of our beings and the Farrars have done a commendable job with this one. I say that this volume is a necessary part of any witches study.Some people will dismiss the entire work because of a postition they do not agree with (a reviewer below advises that this book is dangerous).In my view,I would think that most intelligent and understanding people in the craft will be able to utilize the information presented here as an asset to their own spiritual path. Even information that you feel is wrong is a gift because it can ,if you allow it to, help to strenghten your own beliefs.What in my opinion makes this book, along with all of her published works so valuable to our history is the fact that, like Starhawk and the Spiral Dance, Janet has grown and changed over the years.It is important for us, especially to those who are just setting out on the path to see and undestand how the Craft, modern paganism and Wicca as a religion have developed, stumbled and grown into what we have now, and how it will hopefully do the same as the years move on. As we grow as a movement and learn more about our histories we can only hope that others who are held as leaders in our communities will have the same courage shown by Janet and others to realize that some ideas and understandings no longer work.That being said, I would like to add this: If it were not for the Farrars,Gardner,Doreen Valiente, Raymond Buckland, Ed Fitch,Gavin & Yvonne Frost, Wicca would not exist.We must give honor and respect to those who helped clear the path for the rest of us no matter if we agree with them or not.What draws me to this path is that unlike the big-box religions,the pagan way is one that is and will always be evolving. If we allow ourselves to be open to change, growth and have an unconditional trust in the Gods, we will be able to become the people we were meant to be. And getting there is going to be the journey and adventure of a lifetime.",book
1729,"i think this is a great book for no other reason than the God is generally overlooked in most Pagan traditions. however, this book doesn't do too much to overcome that fact. the section of &quot;war gods&quot; was a joke, showing the typical Wiccan preference for all things female. the invocation to Loki was laughable, while the invocation to Zeus was a play! and just for the record, if the Ferrars are so anti-war god, why on earth do they include any invocations to deities such as Loki Laufeyson, the god who brought about Ragnarok with his malicious deeds?!? just curious, really. i found a lot of the info in this book to be helpful, but some of the opinions and invocations made this book only &quot;average&quot; as opposed to great. i will say this though, it is worth it for the index of gods alone.",book

It gives an excellent overview of various mathematical and computer science areas, including but not limited to combinatorial geometry, NP-problems, complexity theory, graph theory, algorithm analysis, dynamic programming and even computational geometry.Most of the chapters are intended for a senior level undergraduate and graduate student, but some (such as part 4 devoted to complexity problems) are more suitable for &quot;mature&quot; audience and require some preliminary knowledge in the area.I found chapters on sorting, data structures, recursion and functional programming well written and structured, and examples to be practical as well as informative.Sections on amortized analysis, randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms and iteration improvement deal with current directions in the algorithmic research and provide an excellent overview of the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in these areas. I also enjoyed reading through the section on greedy algorithms (shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems).Section on computational complexity and analysis of the relationship between complexity classes seems to be a bit complicated, those who are interested in this area should probably do some preliminary reading.The last section on computational geometry (my area of expertise) and applications of Voronoi diagrams could be extended, but even in the current state it givs a pretty good idea of what computational geometry is all about.Overall, I give to this book a &quot;5 star&quot; review and recommend it for anyone who is seriously interested in learning exactly how algorithm design and analysis work. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can only wish that author would write more books like that in the future!",book
1731,"This is a great book overall, but I give it 4 stars as it lacks the mathematical explanations that I personally was looking for. I am graduate student in Computer Science and a E-Commerce Consultant by profession. This book is more detailed than the Sedweick (I can't spell his name) in the sense that it has some more of a mathematical approach. It lacks the level of explanation that the Sedweick book provided. It has some math, but overlooks some steps thus targeting someone with a pretty solid math background, not someone with sophomore level undergraduate math background.Overall.. if you're a student taking an algorithms or advanced algorithms class (especially a graduate class), you might want to invest in this book.",book
1732,"I have studied both undergrad and grad algorithm courses from this book at KFUPM. For a beginner, the author provides a moderate level of mathematical analysis which helps in building a solid foundation, but avoids minor details that may obscure the overall grasp of the subject. The Exercise sets at the end of each chapter vary from easy to challenging....",book
1733,"Excellent read, for children or for any age; also for adults who want to get to know Saint Rose of Lima.",book

1735,"From the start one thing needs to be made very clear about this book. It is a nice read for a Democrat, especially a partisan Democrat like myself. My Republican friends on the other hand would, I'm afraid find very little interesting about this book. Simply put, this is a very one sided view of history. Democrats tend to be pictured in the best possible light from page one. This is not to say that Mr. Rutland has not done his homework for he has. I don't think he ever set out to write an impartial historical epic. What he seems to have intended is basicly a survey type textbook for Democrats. If that was his goal he has accomplished it. Someone looking for a quick political history of the United States told from the Democratic point of view will find it here.The simple fact is that Mr. Rutland took upon himself a rather large task in writing a history of the Democratic party. To do this task justice one would have to turn out a work that would rival in length the volumes written by Shelby Foote on the Civil War. In fact, this subject would probably require even more volumes since the subject covers over two hundred years of history. As it is the book in its 241 pages is only able to deal in the most superficial way with its subject.Still this book does a fair job of following America's oldest party from its roots as Jefferson looks to a nation of farmers to today's urban America. Along the way we see the Democrats changing to become the party of the common man and the underdog. We see the party begin to take its present form in 1896 as William Jennings Bryan and his populists take control of the convention. We see more change in 1912 with the nomination of the progressive Woodrow Wilson. Then in 1932 FDR comes along and the Democratic party is forever changed. Old Democratic issues like tariffs and free silver give way to civil rights and labor relations. The direction of the party continues on the course set by Roosevelt as Harry Truman takes over and then LBJ sets off an a path of sweeping social change that for good or bad forever changes the United States. Oddly, the book gives little credit for the present positions of the Democratic party to JFK.There are also a few places in the book where Mr. Rutland's facts are wrong. For example he states that in the election of 1896 William McKinley took T. Roosevelt with him to Washington as his Vice President when in fact T.R. wasn't on the ticket until 1900. For the most part however his facts do seem straight and he covers the subject as well as could be expected in such a short book.Overall, the book could have been more in depth and such a large subject should probably never have been undertaken. I remember in high school english I always tried to choose a very broad topic for any paper I had to write because I figured it would be easy to turn out twenty pages that way. My teacher always called me on my plan though and I had to narrow it down. Maybe Mr. Rutland needed a good high school english teacher to make him do the same here.On the other hand it is hard to study American history without a study of the Democrats. The party of Jefferson has been here through most of our history. So while this book gives one a quick look at the history of one party it also for the most part does the same for American history. Its not a waste of time to read this book by any means but it is more gravy than meat.",book
1736,"Let me say right up front that I was disappointed in this book. Maybe I am too stuck in my ways, but when I pick up a history like this I was looking for an well-organized book. I want each President with his own chapter, some details that are presented for each person i.e. year of terms, Vice President etc, and then a nice review of what took place while in office, the good and the bad. The book just did not provide this; the presidents were grouped into chapters on what seemed to be on a basis as to total average chapter page length not by political or situational similarities. The basic facts that I wanted were not there for every President, and if they were there you needed to hunt for them. And if you are going to give me pictures then at least give me a picture of every President covered in the book, what we got were pictures of a few Presidents, a few campaign adds or jokes, and unbelievably to me pictures of city political bosses.The book was positive; I give the author that. When there were negative issues they were glossed over if even mentioned. I new based on the size of the book that it was not going to be an exhaustive history, but even this brief look at each President left me disappointed. Also I kept thinking that the author wanted to write a history of the Democratic party and the publisher wanted a history of the Democratic Presidents and what came out was a compromise that did not serve either cause very well. I would have much rather had a few more pages on FDR (then the 15 offered) and less about the Kansas City and Chicago political bosses and the third party candidates on some elections. I do not want to be all-negative, there were a number of interesting facts and he hit the high notes on each man. I was interested enough to finish the book. I am just going to have to keep looking for a better effort at this topic.",book
1737,"I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor. I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more.

1738,"&quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; is an excellent book, and provides one of a few lone voices drawing attention to &quot;A Group Society Would Rather Pretend Doesn't Exist:&quot; The Gifted Adult.Adult Giftedness is one of the &quot;Ugly Stepchildren&quot; in the field of Psychology. Whereas researchers, psychologists and society in general go to great lengths to study, understand and help those who dwell a long way below the mean intellect, those living their lives an equal distance the opposite side of the mean often find themselves living in a void of confusion, misunderstanding-- and misinformation. Their lives are perhaps complicated by a &quot;split personality&quot; support system that provides tools and special programs to gifted children, but then vanishes into thin air once the gifted individual is deemed &quot;Adult&quot;-- in some cases providing an abrupt perception change from giftedness as having positive &quot;value&quot; to suddenly being a reason for discrimination and sneers.Gifted Adults are &quot;statistical outliers.&quot; As such, they often have special issues, living in a world whose actions are centered around accommodating the &quot;norm.&quot; At best, a Gifted Adult seeking to have his/her needs understood, may hear the words &quot;Well, we're ALL gifted, in our own special way.&quot; At worst (and more frequently) they will hear &quot;How can you have problems, if you're so smart?&quot;-- words that reflect a popular view that giftedness is a &quot;privilege&quot; that exempts a person from having any difficulties in life. Yet, Gifted Adults discover that working harder, seeking answers, seeing therapists and trying to contribute often leaves them with a sense of &quot;emptiness&quot; and lack of fulfillment.Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's book is a much-needed tool to help gifted adults understand themselves, and accept the fact that their brains work a little bit differently. Real differences, I might add, that change the way a gifted person views their interactions with the world, their road to self-actualization, or considerations for seeking therapy.In Part I of the book, Jacobsen starts to define her own view of giftedness, and addresses some of the Societal Myths (Giftedness = High IQ), and influences (Gifted adults' tendency to deny their giftedness) established by conventional thinking.In Part II, she presents her alternative theory for measuring giftedness-- a broad system she has named &quot;Evolutionary Intelligence&quot; (or EvIQ). Although Jacobsen &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from the &quot;Multiple Intelligences&quot; theory originally set forth by Howard Gardner at Harvard, she adds a number of new facets, presented in a 240-item &quot;self quiz&quot; in Chapter 7 of the book. Unlike &quot;standard&quot; IQ tests, this is NOT a timed exercise with &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; answers, but rather a self-evaluation. Of course, honest self-scrutiny is central to obtaining a &quot;valid&quot; result-- which may present difficulty for some.Part III explores most of the common &quot;misunderstandings&quot; gifted adults encounter in their interactions with daily life. Topics include &quot;self mis-diagnoses;&quot; the issues associated with &quot;Failing to Fit In;&quot; rewriting personal history and past events through understanding &quot;common criticisms&quot; often heard by gifted adults (&quot;Can't you just stick with ONE thing?&quot; &quot;Where do you get those wild ideas?&quot; &quot;Can't you just slow down?&quot;); the &quot;False Self&quot; and dumbing yourself down; as well as the &quot;Impostor Syndrome&quot; gifted adults often experience.Parts IV and V offer a series of tools and possible solutions to help gifted adults reorient their energies in an effort to create lives that let them be &quot;true to themselves&quot;-- while still fitting into the &quot;normalcy&quot; of their surroundings. In part IV, Jacobsen explores both career issues and personal relationships, however, I found this section to be a bit general and &quot;pep-talkish.&quot; The final section deals with summarizing and then applying the lessons learned in the book.Observations: My general inclination is to say &quot; Buy this book! Buy it NOW! Read it! Learn!&quot;However, the potential reader should understand just what the book will do for them. &quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; (Formerly published under the name &quot;Liberating Everyday Genius&quot;-- the name change is a GOOD idea!) is long on presenting Jacobsen's theory of Evolutionary Intelligence, and long on providing self-understanding for the gifted adult-- but somewhat short as a &quot;How-To&quot; guidebook on how to live life. If you're looking for &quot;connect A to B&quot; solutions, you'll find only a limited number here.The author is also quite &quot;liberal&quot; with her use of the designation &quot;gifted.&quot; Normally, the term is used to describe approximately 2% of the population. Jacobsen's definition may include as many as 10%-- and whether this is merely a technique to sell more books, or a figure backed by scientific research, I do not know. It doesn't detract materially from the value of the information presented-- but at times the writing does become a little bit &quot;fluffy&quot; and lacking in focus.Some personal thoughts (Caveats): Society is engaged in a long-term love affair with the idea of &quot;pathologizing&quot; any behavior not tightly clustered around a narrow definition of &quot;Normal.&quot; Incorrectly diagnosing and medicating giftedness as ADHD or Bipolar Disorder responds to a popular need for &quot;A Quick And Easy Fix.&quot; If AT ALL possible, we want a &quot;magic pill&quot; rather than &quot;hard work.&quot; And whereas disorders certainly DO occur, Adult Giftedness-- and the psychological makeup specific to it-- is NOT a pathology.Overall rating: Outstanding (9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the gifted adult and anyone living with a gifted adult, but the book also should be required reading for any psychologist/therapist who's been asked if they are &quot;familiar with the psychology of Adult Giftedness.&quot;",book
1739,"In general, I found this book very enlightening. I differ in one respect from most of the &quot;everyday geniuses&quot; the author describes: early in life I was identified as having a high IQ. But my parents and teachers suffered from the misconception that this was an isolated trait and, in all other respects, I was a completely normal child. It was fine with them that I learned quickly, but the qualities that they found less agreeable (my determination, enthusiasm, sensitivity, and immensely wide variety of interests) were redefined as negatives: I was &quot;stubborn,&quot; &quot;unfocused,&quot; &quot;hasty,&quot; &quot;too emotional,&quot; and so on. Plus the ideals that I was supposed to achieve -- get straight A's in school, be quiet and well-behaved, specify a career goal and pursue it -- didn't appeal to me in the least; I didn't want an ordinary life, I wanted an extraordinary one. But I grew up believing that, by refusing to squeeze myself into the slots that society provided, I was &quot;failing to live up to my potential.&quot;It wasn't until recently that I learned that there's more to giftedness than a high IQ or a talent in a particular area. Palladino's &quot;Dreamers, Discoverers, and Dynamos,&quot; Gardner's work on &quot;multiple intelligences,&quot; and many other books point out that the gifted child's mind actually works differently: intensity, drive, and sensitivity are all part of the package (which Palladino characterizes as &quot;divergent thinking&quot;). But the dividing line between genius and ADD is a blurry one, and our educational system's emphasis on normality and conformity often leads to defining any &quot;divergence&quot; as pathological or, at best, as misbehavior.This book is a great antidote to such thinking. The author gives a self-test that enables the &quot;everyday genius&quot; to identify his/her strengths and personality traits, and I found the results interesting. Also very helpful are the lengthy sections on redefining your supposed negatives as positives: you're not someone who needs to &quot;slow down&quot;; doing things quickly is normal for you. I was greatly reassured to discover that my burning desire to &quot;make a difference in the world&quot; didn't stem from arrogance (which more than one teacher had scolded me for), but was, rather, a typical part of the high-EvI package. Although I don't agree with all of the author's suggestions in the &quot;self-help&quot; chapters, I think she's making an important point: the &quot;everyday genius&quot; can live and work effectively in the world not by suppressing his/her strengths, but by practicing self-discipline to use these strengths in the service of a higher goal. Given the scarcity of books written specifically for gifted adults (rather than children), this book fills a great need, and does it well.I have only one quibble with the book, but it caused me to rate it with four stars rather than five. The author says things like &quot;studies have shown ...&quot;, but she almost never gives the references for these studies; the footnotes to the chapters rarely mention research at all. I realize that she's writing a &quot;popular&quot; book rather than a scholarly work, and that many of her conclusions are based on her experience with her clients rather than on scientific research. But I feel it would give her conclusions far more credibility if she backed them up with harder data.",book
1740,"This is a review of the book ""Liberating Everday Genius"" by Jacobsen; I'm not sure if this book is the same under another name or if this new book offers more than the older version previously published.I read this book in hopes that it would actually teach me how to liberate my creativity and intelligence. Unfortunately, most of what it offers is mere information and theory regarding what ""everyday genius"" is and how to tell if you are one using a rather generic ""test."" It then goes on to dispel myths and stereotypes that most ""geniuses"" seem to experience. I know that I found a lot of myself in this book although I'm not sure I'd call myself a genius. Perhaps I overestimate what the term really means, thus fitting in to the descriptions she gives of how society pushes down anyone who thinks differently than the majority. Sadly, none of my big questions were answered such as, ""how do I overcome this programming?"" I am just as confused and feel just as alone as I did prior to reading the book, so I can't say it has been any help to me except to point out that maybe there are others out there like me. What's the point if I still feel too lost to find them and to express my ""true"" self? Much of the material is repetitive in that she presents the same ideas and concepts over and over again. I assume she's trying to drill it into the head of the reader, but perhaps it's just book filler. I think she could have compacted the material into a book half the original size, thus lowering the price in the process. If you buy it, expect to be reading a Tony Robbins type self-esteem booster...do not expect to find real answers.",book
1741,"For someone who's gifted, Jacobsen's book can bring a sigh of relief and recognition. &quot;I'm not an ugly duckling after all! I was meant to be a swan.&quot;While some reviewers criticize this book as &quot;elitist,&quot; I find the opposite. Jacobsen doesn't suggest that anyone be exempt from social norms or rules. To the contrary, she shows that the gifted may face a tougher challenge than the less-gifted: they must learn to accommodate to a society as an invisible often-resented minority group. It's up to each gifted person -- hopefully aided by mentors who can take advantage of &quot;teaching moments&quot; -- to learn to swim. That means adjusting a blunt style of speaking, communicating in a new style and, always, dealing with the loneliness of being &quot;different.&quot; Gifted people tend to attract envy, not empathy, and they don't always grow into rich and successful adults. Indeed, without recognition early in life, the gifted can become severely depressed, mainly due to isolation.Once you read this book, it's easy to recognize evidence of giftedness in yourself and others, including autobiographical accounts. A combination of characteristics -- sensitivity, high-speed, high-energy -- can appear frustrating to those who don't realize what's going on. Many gifted children get diagnosed as hyperactive, depressed, socially inept and worse.I'm not overfond of pencil-and-paper tests, but Jacobsen offers ways to identify specific areas of giftedness through some simple questions. Readers can ignore this part if they choose.Counselors, career coaches, therapists, managers, guidance professionals -- all should have this book on their shelves. When they find themselves getting overwhelmed by a gifted client, they need to know what's going on.",book
1742,"Mary-Elaine Jacobsen brings the largely invisible plights and possibilities of the gifted adult to our attention. As an intense, complex and driven gifted adult, myself, I truly appreciate her contribution to my life and the lives of others I know who've read the book. As a therapist to gifted adults for many years, Jacobsen knows what she's talking about and gives us many moving stories to find ourselves, our friends or our parents in. I cried many tears reading this book, remembering experiences in my own life and seeing them in a more self-compassionate light.I've known I was smart, intense and driven but Jacobsen helped me to see why and what to do about it to have a happier, more fulfilled life. I'm probably writing this review right now because of the influence of this book. I've always craved to get my ideas out in the world and here on the Net and in my blog (tokerud's technology treats) I've sought out ways to do that. Jacobsen gives the gifted adult the good news and the bad news. The good news is great. I can forgive myself. The bad news is, that the only way things are going to change is for me to change some bad habits and be constructive and persistent in the world and express my gifts. If you know you are intense and driven and probably pretty smart, pick this book up. It could change YOUR life too.This book is a well-written but occasionally dense read. However, it will be a page-turner for a gifted adult. And, for that matter, gifted adults tend to like dense books. One of the unfortunate facts that Jacobsen points out is that gifted adults have usually learned to keep a low profile about their giftedness. They've learned to cover it up and at a certain point in their lives, many gifted adults forget they are gifted. It is a convenient but, ultimately, very harmful defense mechanism. That's why I said earlier that if you merely suspect you might possibly be a gifted adult, read this book! It will shake you out of your unconsciousness and get you back on the track of getting your gifts out into the world where they belong!",book
1743,"I had to laugh at the editorial review, which accuses Dr. Jacobsen of being ""elitist,"" one of the many criticisms that gifted people receive. Maybe that reviewer should have read the book more carefully. This is a terrific book that will help people realize their potential. That's a good thing for the world and should not be discouraged or belittled.If you have struggled with fitting in only to feel like you cannot be your authentic self, this book will help you discover why. I also recommend ""Dark Side of the Light Chasers"" and other books by Debbie Ford to help you discover the damage done by all those messages to play small, and begin to heal, giving yourself permission to be BIG.",book
1744,"I give this book three stars because everything the author says is right on the money. I did not give it 5 stars because the book is repetitious and the language rambling. I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I had trouble finishing it. I would have liked less preaching about liberating yourself and more insights on how to do it from examples of people who have done it. There are examples, but not as many as I would have liked, and not described in enough depth.I gained more insights from &quot;Gifted Grownups&quot; by Marylou Kelly Streznewski. Her section about the physiology of giftedness, in particular, covered material I have not seen anywhere else.In the end, how much you enjoy this book will depend much on how comfortable you are with your giftedness. If you have not become comfortable with being &quot;different&quot;, you will probably value this book. If you are comfortable with the real gifted you, this is probably not the book for you.",book
1745,"Imagine you owned a Ferrari Testarossa. Imagine that your Ferrari is the only car you will ever have. Now imagine that your Ferrari not only sets land speed records and wins road rallies, but has to be a daily commuter car, carry loads like a pick-up, handle deep snow like a SUV, and be the car that your kids learn to drive on. Now add to the mix that you *expect* your Ferrari to have the insurance rates, gas mileage, and maintenance requirements of the Honda Accords that everyone else has. Now imagine that you truly think your Ferrari is a Honda, and you're deeply, fundamentally distressed that it gives you so much pleasure but so many problems.Welcome to reality as experienced by the Gifted.The insights provided by the book were nothing less than a series of epiphanies for me. The author not only provides information around the fact that Giftedness has little correlation with high IQ, she also details the discrete set of personality characteristics typical of the Gifted, with a clear listing of the pitfalls and benefits derived from those characteristics. She explains how those &quot;quirks&quot; demand that Gifted people care for themselves in very different ways. She then goes on to dispel any myth that a Gifted person may have that they are &quot;better&quot; than non-Gifted people, while simultaneously providing encouragement to and insight into getting beyond the difficulties attendant with being a Ferrari in a Honda world.If you are Gifted, work with,live with or love one, *please* read this book. It will make all your lives a lot easier. (And we're not quite as rare as you'd think!)",book
1746,"This book was a disappointment. Jacobsen spends the majority of this book verbosely reassuring the insecure reader that he or she (somehow, I get the distinct impression that Jacobsen assumes the reader to be probably female rather than male) is indeed a precious flower. Well, I don't need to be told I'm a precious flower. I know that already. What I need to know is where I can find ground to plant myself in where I won't wither and die. Unfortunately, Jacobsen is long on reassurance but short on practical advice. This book contains several useful self-diagnostic tools, which aid in developing greater self-awareness, but the reader is left to figure out what to do with that information. I felt most keenly the lack of even the most basic advice on how to identify one's ""Mandated Mission."" Great phrase. Great concept. I can FEEL exactly what she's talking about. But I don't know what my Mandated Mission IS or how to go about identifying it, and she doesn't explain.The subtitle promises ""A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius."" That is not what this book is. It's not revolutionary, only exhortatory. It offers hope of liberation, but it doesn't actually provide any. ""The Gifted Adult"" needs two things: a less indulgent editor and a more pragmatic follow-up.",book
1747,"In an article in Advanced Development journal, Mary-Elaine Jacobsen noted the typical stereotypes of gifted people include the ""temperamental artist, or the pathetic isolate whose brainy abilities are lost in foolishness, alcoholism or chronic depression,"" and the glittering superstar in the arts or sciences with talents elevating them [more or less effortlessly] to ""an unreachable pedestal of human achievement.""One of the great values of her book is in showing how more ordinary people with exceptional abilities and sensitivities face challenges in, first of all, recognizing themselves, then realizing their multiple talents.All too often, gifted adults [and children] get labeled as being problematical or pathological. Her book helps to better understand a range of gifted personality traits that can be embraced and used for living a more authentic and fulfilling life.",book
1748,"I agree with the other reviews in that this book is an eye opener if you are not already aware of the 'new' research into giftedness. I would like to make two comments though.First, as one reviewer puts it, the book is lavish on the description of the gifted' characteristics and the difficulties that they encounter in their lives, but is lacking in now-what-do-I do. This is not exactly true. There are many pieces of advice that the author gives on how you can manage those traits that make it so difficult to fit in. However, it takes time for what you've read to sink in. For example, suppose that your social life has not been that great lately and you start feeling depressed. Looking back in time at similar situations, you'd probably decide that you need to make more friends or even find a partner. However, that may not really be the case. It could be that, as the author has so written, you have not been entertaining that necessity of the gifted to have a continual indulging in some kind of interest or passion. As the author puts it, the gifted have `multiple interests' and must always be involved in some kind of pursuit or another. Whenever you feel the blues, turn to the book, look hard and you'd probably find what you're looking for. Most likely, the advice contained in the book can be condensed to fit on just one page; but every single advice is priceless if you take a pause and give it the consideration and time of thought that it needs in order to be effective and long-lasting. The problem is that the book can never substitute for therapy and trying to use it as a manual or workbook is just extremely hard work as is the case with any book anyway. You'd have to be a professional yourself.My second comment is that I find interesting analogies between the Lion sign of western astrology, the Dragon sign of Chinese astrology and the gifted' description. I'd say that these characteristics have been observed throughout the ages and there's nothing really new under the sun except that these traits are now being studied using the 'modern' tools of human psychology.Last, I'd like to say that since it feels very awkward to call yourself gifted, how about `smd' , sensitivity more developed, since the term `hsp' has already been coined. I'd say that the gifted are most different from others in their sensitivity. Like the French say, these people have `une sensibilit&eacute; &agrave; fleur de peau'. To be a `smd' is a way of life and, alas, a constant struggle.",book
1749,"I found this book very helpful in learning to understand my creativity/ idealism and drivenness, that these things are normal for about 8% of the population and I am not alone or wierd, just gifted. Very reassuring and confidence boosting.I now spot giftedness in others, see how they, too are underachieving in order to fit in, and recommend this book to them. Worth every cent!",book
1750,"Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride.",book
1751,"This is definitely best of (not many) books for gifted adults (of books not focused only on gifted children). Absolutely informative, describing everything from stories to theory and personality traits behind giftedness. There is no other book at the same level of information and help for gifted adults. I agree with other reviews - if you expect this book will give you ultimate answers and ready-made solutions to adapt to your life, you will be disappointed. It is better to expect this book to be interesting inquiry into the soul of gifted people, with several ideas what to do and what to change in your lifestyle, however you will stay alone with final decisions and this book can be inspiration for creating more ideas for changing your lifestyle. Chapters of practical help (managing gifted adult life) are not the strongest point of the book. Generally they advise you - do not be either too extreme, or too inhibited in showing up your traits. Learn to balance your self- expression. No more ideas... However you (as probably gifted adult) do not expect one book with all solutions to your life, do you? This book is definitely a must for everybody who is lost, is trying to orient, or trying to get more information about giftedness in adult people. Week points - 1) It is sometimes too repetitive and wordy, 2) Concepts like ""Evolutionary Intelligence"" or ""Everyday genius"" are useless, confusing and presented probably with understandable intention of the author to suggest new theory, however these concepts are not elaborated well and sound too ""new age"". Up-to-date psychological terminology would be sufficient. Still, five stars are absolutely fair for this book.",book
1752,"I loved this book. It's not just kids who can have the odd, creative, surprising characteristics of 'gifted'...What do we think Gifted Kids grow up into? Normal adults? Not by a longshot!Do you ever feel like an outsider, wondering 'Why don't I see the world the way my peers do?' This book may help you figure out something about yourself. Even if you weren't diagnosed as gifted (Yeah..it could also be called 'Cursed'), your current disconnect with other people may be the product of a quirky ""gifted"" mind. If you're married to one of these personalities, this book can help you understand very frustrating traits in a new way.My biggest issue with this book, though, is the term 'Gifted'. The author even addresses this - it carries a connotation of a value judgement, and honestly, when the book outlines the social difficulties and rejections of gifted adults by other personality types, ""Cursed"" is just as valid a label. There's nothing better about being Gifted...they're just different. A lovely difference, when harnessed correctly and when a gifted finds their ""flock"", but I hesitate to stray from an egalitarian viewpoint on varying human personality types.My second biggest issue is that although the need to connect with other Gifteds is identified, it doesn't give much of a blueprint for Gifteds to find their own kind in the world. Mensa was the only group mentioned that I could see, and that group only applies to a very small subset of the personality types the book. Because the term 'gifted' is greatly disliked by some gifteds, they're not likely to rally around it to find each other.But, this book clearly identifies a set of traits found in certain people, and gives them a name, along with a possible set of approaches to life for coping with this particular way of being. For that, it shines.",book
1753,"Been confused for so long about who I am, this book truly liberates the blockages that the author has so welled expressed and put in words, I felt a re-newed strength that I was on the right track, but now with less of a fight. Thanks for the support and the insights.",book
1754,"This is a book for above average people, more like the top 25%. If you made the National Honor Society in High School, or you're just a good person who got B's and does volunteer work, then you are a gifted adult. The author's definition of gifted is broad, and you fit if you've got it together and give something back to your community. Jacobsen really hits 'The Betterment of Mankind' (Mandated Mission) as the primary motive of the gifted, so if you are *already* involved with that, welcome to the gifted club.Part of my problem with the contents of this book is that the writer was a woman, and the content more for women. (That was my impression as a male reader.) Jacobsen assumes part of being gifted is the exercise of empathy. A person can attempt the betterment of mankind by constructing challenges instead of charity. A big part of the book pre-supposes that any humanity-centric course of action is tied to overflowing empathy, and I personally don't agree.I found much of the book devoted to convincing people they were gifted, and once that was done, attempting to convince the gifted that part of the responsibility of being gifted is the betterment of mankind. This was a worthy, noble ideal. Still, somewhere along the line, the author switches more into a visionary 'this-is-how-it-should-be' mode than a simple guide to help the everyday genius realize their potential. Not all of us want to put everything into the 'betterment of mankind', for some of us, it is already our day job.Overall, the book made me feel unworthy to be gifted since I don't devote myself to the 'betterment of mankind' 24-7, and I didn't like that. Still had some helpful perspectives on 'advanced development', but I wish the author had been more flexible regarding personal happiness. I could be perfectly happy without ever chasing a nebulous ideal, and I don't like that following your own 'selfish' dreams are viewed as against much of the 'advanced development' section if they don't achieve the 'betterment of mankind'. Additionally, found it lacking substance; much of the book is cheer-leading (go self-esteem!) without specifics. (Example, p312 on 'rational intuition', ""Learn to the tell the difference between a hunch, a feeling, and inner guidance."" That's it. No advice or instruction on the actual process.... love to take that advice if only I knew how.)This is a book I'd give to a smart person who is unaware they are smart, but not to a real genius. The cover is misleading with the use of 'genius', when it really means 'gifted'. The target audience (75-98 percentile in intelligence) is smart people who know they aren't geniuses and want to better utilize what they have. I don't believe this is well-expressed, and much of the book is helping smart realize they are indeed worthy. If you are already aware of your own gifts, then you may even find the book annoying.",book
1755,"I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are &#34;different.&#34; I never knew so many things I thought were &#34;wrong&#34; with me were commonalities to being gifted. Now that I know, I recognize it in my friends and students and I finally have a structured way to improve how I communicate and interact with &#34;normal&#34; people. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's smart and feels like they don't fit in.",book
1756,"The Book is very informitive. And worth the time. I never knew that there is several types of gift people. I believe that their are many undiscovered genius out there. But never knew that others, knew it too. I felt so out place. The things in the book. Was like I talk to the author about it. Myself. I was a child of the late twentith century. For the longest time. I never knew that one of many forgotten of the system they called modern society. The lost of how many minds, how many talents ignored. How many potential discovery unfound. For every gifted person known. There are possible maybe two or three times as many not unkown. It's like putting a child in special educations. And being told he or she is mental tarded. And then told several years later. The child was normal.And he or she could go back regular school. The damage that was to the child. Could very well scar them. In many ways. We need to fix the problems, not sweep it under rug, so to speak. We need to be on equal footing. Basical we need understanding, not the controlers.",book
1757,"As a gifted adult myself, this book has helped me understand many aspects of the process of becoming a conscious gifted adult. I've ordered this book for the second time, to share it with a close friend of mine. Instead of being study literature (like 'How the gifted brain learns', which, for other purposes, is another excellent read - mostly if you are teaching or coaching gifted people), the book is mostly full of 'aha-moments' and reads quite easily. I discovered a kind of trajectory in the book, where I naturally found my 'spot'; so there's three 'parts' regarding past, now and future hidden in the book.The first part is mostly recognizing and reframing the past. It describes cases, including the auther herself at some point, about the process from being full of perceptions about yourself (all the typical elements of gifted people are translated into negative views, mostly how non-gifted people perceive the gifted) until realizing how these elements many of us got to dislike or hate in their lives can be qualities.The second part, including the Evolutionary Intelligence model, contains some tools to get more insight into your personal development needs. This felt for me as the 'now'.Also, the author describes how she got to do work that connects directly to her soul calling, or life mission, or personal passion as you will. A life-changing insight for me, which I found also in other books, is that with the current world-wide crisis it is no wonder that more gifted and talented people are being born. Finding our way, creating coaching and therapy for gifted people (and recognizing all the misdiagnosis going on, because of ADHD and other mental disorders in DSM-IV but no good, 'official' literature on giftedness and its effects) but also transforming our educational systems and training human resource departments at big companies, is essential to help the planet in her process. For me this is the future, I don't feel I have the role that connects exactly to this, but the call is getting stronger. So, since they say 'patience is a virtue', I train myself in taking my time. Not everything has to be finished yesterday? Aha! ;-)",book
1758,"This book is quite a treat: funny, straight-forward and hits home addressing the reasons that generate anxiety for not being a result of the cookie-cutter. Priceless.The material is very interesting and presented in a common-sense manner; ultimately, very useful in validating our differentness from the mainstream and teaching how to manage and explore our uniqueness instead of fighting it.I have highlighted sections in almost every page and realize that I will be coming back to this book over and over again.I highly recommend it.",book
1759,This is the book gifted adults need to know who they are and that there giftedness is not only normal but very much needed by the world.Most gifted adults find it hard to believe they are gifted.This book helps you unlock your true inner self and bring your giftedness to the forefront to live life as you were meant to.,book
1760,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains.",book
1761,"""Of course you're different. You're intense, complex, and driven because you're gifted."" ~ Mary-Elaine Jacobsen, Psy.D. from ""The Gifted Adult""""The Gifted Adult."" This may be a book that you missed despite the fact that it is read by many people all over the world. I still can't remember how I discovered it but I'm thrilled I did. And, I think you're going to love it.If you're even reading this review, odds are you're one of the millions of ""Everyday Geniuses"" out there (she counts 20 million in the US alone) looking to most fully and authentically give their gifts to the world... but, unfortunately, too often feeling a sense of purpose that is not quite being fulfilled.That sound vaguely familiar? If so, I HIGHLY recommend the book. It was a life changer when I first read it several years ago and it's been refreshing to re-read it after quite a bit of growth--reflecting on the seeds planted by the book that have now taken firm root in my life.",book
1762,"I have just gone through one fifth of the book so far, but I have been very surprised about how well the author describes personality traits of gifted individuals. Taking a quick look at other chapters it seemed to offer very interesting, deep and detailed looks at every relevant aspect of life, the problems it poses to gifted individuals and ways to confront it.Do not expect a scientific study, but rather a work created wholeheartedly out of intuition by somebody directly affected by the issue who intends to teach those blessed/doomed by giftedness why and how they are the way they are, and how to be happy and proud by being themselves and making the best out of their traits.All together an extremely interesting workpiece for those interested in or affected by giftedness.",book

1764,"I just think it's very funny that everyone reviewing books on ""giftedness"" sees themselves in the book (""wow! that's me!""). If you go look at the reviews on troubled, emotionally unstable, or parenting children with depression/hyperactivity/schizophrenia/borderline personality disorder/ autism, the reviews are much more dissociative (""oh, thank god I'm not alone with my troubling child. I knew something was wrong with him, but I never knew what. I'm going to completely ignore all genetic components of these issues, because these are highly stigmatized, as well as environmental issues, because that would somehow imply poor parenting, and just pretend this is an alien baby dropped in my lap."")We just love to own things about ourselves and our kids that society thinks are flattering, and shove off those that are disparaging. People are so ridiculous.Even the reviews here are pretentious - everyone is trying to sound like some poor, sad, erudite loner. ""Oh, I'm just this brilliant person, trapped in a sea of idiocy, and no one knows it. Now I know why I felt so lonely!"" No - everyone feels lonely and isolated at times, sometimes for long periods of time. It's just part of the human condition - we're gregarious, but distrustful and filled with ego, and our need for approval precludes us from showing our flaws to others whenever possible. We can't be our ""true"" selves with most people, so we feel isolated, as though our emotions and flaws are personal only to us, which is a completely ridiculous fallacy, because everyone is doing the same thing. In the words of R. Kelly: We be frontin'.Everyone thinks they're brilliant, or have great taste, or have better judgment than the masses. But, by definition, this isn't true. Most people, by definition, are mediocre. So are we, reviewers. Most people leave no impression on the world, and having a ""high IQ"" - which many are so proud of here - is (a) just a quirk of nature (the same genetic trick that made you have a high IQ, if true, could have gone another way and given you a low one. You're closer to stupidity than normalcy. and (b) is not that relevant when it comes to making any positive impact on society, animals, biology, history, or anything else (which is what the pretentious presumably want). High sociability is more important. Oops.Our daughter is very smart, but we always tell her that's her least interesting characteristic. It's like telling her that she's beautiful - it's a genetic boon, and hardly something to boast about. Then what - those who are intelligent and beautiful are better than those who are dumb and ugly? Sounds about right - and incredibly wrong. Her best characteristics are her incredibly generous heart, her readiness to help, to great sense of humor, her ability to pick herself back up after she falls and keep going, and her willingness to laugh at herself.She's a brilliant kid who's going to grow up to be a happy, connected, accepting adult. She'll impact society in some manner - large or very, very tiny - because happiness always does that. Worship beauty or intellect and you get Donald Trump or the Unabomber.I think I'll stick with our method.",book
1765,"This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences.

It was a battle as titanic as any fought by the armies on the Western Front.Houston knows the streets, hills, and canyons of Bisbee. His original writing style transports the reader back to those volcanic days in the blast furnace heat of southern Arizona where the Wobblies of the International Workers of the World (IWW) clashed with the mine owners who in turn were backed by the county sherrif, cowboys, and the Eastern Establishment. Copper was essential to the war effort. The IWW hoped that shutting down the mines would cause a crisis in captialism, halt the war, and spark a revolution; it was all about class warfare. The mine owners feared the end of civilization or as one protagonist in the book puts it, ""the end of the City of God."" The reader witnesses the build-up and explosion through the eyes of characters whose personal lives and fortunes are hinged upon the outcome of the battle. For a historical perspective, the novel lays bare the insecurities and predjucies of American society during the WWI era as viewed through the prism of the West.This novel is a keeper. After reading it, a trip to historic Bisbee, Arizona is in order.",book

Now Amy Nathan, author of ""The Young Musician's survival Guide,"" gives us her latest book which proves we're not alone. ""Meet the Musicians"" is an upbeat, informative, up-close-and-personal look at 15 professional musicians all members of the New York Philharmonic. Many of them didn't like to practice when they were kids any more than we did. As adults and accomplished, disciplined musicians they offer excellent practice tips for both parents and children as well as sharing the paths they took to being part of a world class symphony orchestra.Beginning with Carter Brey, Cello and concluding with John Deak, Bass we find photos of these musicians as children, their favorite childhood activities, their educational backgrounds, the inside scoop on particular instruments, how they came to be members of the New York Philharmonic and brief biographical sketches.Young readers will easily relate to these musicians on many different levels.Violist Cynthia Phelps said, ""When I'm on stage, I think I'm the luckiest person in the world, having such a good time doing what I love to do.""

1777,The definitive history of Army Aviation from the beginning to present operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you like aviation history this is a wonderful resource. Should be in every library collection. A great gift for anyone interested in aviation.,book
1778,"This book covers a lot of ground, but suffers a bit from the sheer amount of detail. The organizational changes in Army Aviation are highlighted, and it is useful to know what organizational structures have been implemented at various times, but the cohesiveness of the story is often sidetracked. It is always a struggle to produce an exhaustive history while explaining how these details relate to the bigger picture, so I sympathize with the author.Unfortunately, it felt as though a large portion of the book was spent slogging through minutiae, and chronological progression was interspersed with thematic progression. I would give the content 4 stars, principally because the applications of aviation in particular engagements was given limited treatment, as were the advances in technology.I think that the best insight that I found in the book was the discussion of the particular difficulties encountered by the Army in providing for equivalent career development for soldiers in Aviation. In this regard, the author recounted the events as a continuing theme, and developed it into a cohesive story.I don't think that I could reconcile the desire to document all of the events covered in this book with a cohesive and engaging story without adding at least 50% to its length, so maybe that is the constraint that prevailed.The readability of the book makes it overall 3 stars in my opinion. As a reference, this book could be useful, but the astounding detail of the book makes the whole volume a giant index, and finding particular discussions requires knowing a priori where to look chronologically and thematically.",book

1784,"This book tackles international computer system threats that face nations and corporations head on. It presents a theoretical framework for action and will be a valuable resource for the next decade.Athena was also a serious topic in ancient times when she was the Greek god with a sword and shield, the one who thought up the first Trojan horse... a legacy that connects well with today's netwars.The authors of each chapter address different issues. Most are from the perspective of military issues. Many use clear historic perspectives to show how one side or the other lost conflicts, for example, the use of smart networks by Mongols to defeat Muslims and by Ho Chi Minh against Lyndon Johnson. Other examples are drawn from the gulf war; the chief of which is that the next opponent will likely not be as dumb as Saddam.Oddly there isn't much in the book about China and Russia, the cyber-bullies of today's world. Even if one did want to look up material on these countries the missing index prevents it. With a new abbreviation on every page it would also be helpful to have a Rosetta stone inside the back cover.The example of the wild west is used and very applicable here. There are only isolated pockets of law and order. Good and bad guys are hard to distinguish. Outside occasional enclaves good guys can only trust their resources and a few friends. This high level discussion can be directly translated to domains, firewalls, and virtual private networks. It argues against lowest-bidder security implementations.Computer network managers will understand diminishing role of government in the direction of commercial systems. This means less traditional compliance-driven security technology will be available. Corporate security, network administrators and infrastructure managers are out there on their own. &quot;Street smart&quot; information behavior will be necessary to survive.Through the book the term &quot;cyber&quot; is overused. It almost never appears in serious government discussions or commercial security where the emphasis is on all aspects of network issues.Security managers who want a superficial self improvement should skip this book. It is very concept-dense and filled with ideas which will cause the reader to stop and think about strategy. Few solution specifics are presented. Concepts in this book are suited for someone who is developing a strategic vision for protecting their organization from network attacks.[adapted from a review published in Security Management.

It includes rehearsal techniques, gives voice instruction guidelines, and focuses on performance practice for each major style period in the western tradition. It even has diction charts for all the major choral languages.

As stated by Derrida, &quot;every drawing of 'the blind' is a drawing 'of' the blind.&quot; More than just an example of applied deconstruction, Derrida's reading of these drawings questions the very foudnation of western ideologies of 'looking' and 'seeing' taken for granted as self-evident by artists for centuries. By the end, one wonders who is the author, the artist, the curator?, as Derrida does more with these drawings 'for drawing' than they ever did for drawing themselves.

I assure you, I will buy that one too. Don't mix the focus.As well, for people my age, there is a need for reading glasses. But reading glasses, and falling in the dojo don't go well together. So, I think that a larger book would be appropriate, e.g. 8.5"" x 11"". But, there are DVDs apparently. Maybe that would be better for me.As for the remaining 75%, they were filled with techniques. Unlike some other reviewers, I WANTED to see more and more techniques. They were not problematic to follow, rather easy actually. There were several panels with exceptionally close photography for some techniques, and I would judge them as being required.I was very pleased with this purchase. It has earned a permanent spot in my library - Self-Defense section. It has helped me with my learning and never ending quest to perfect my Combat Hapkido joint lock studies.VERY MUCH WORTH THE PURCHASE !!!",book
1797,"Wally Jay is the guru of all Ju-jitsu. I've studied Ju-Jitsu for 4 years and this book was a great companion to my classes. Now, I study Gracie Ju-jitsu and this book is still helpful even though the systems I've studied are different. A must for all practitioners of the art.",book
1798,"This is a very good book on the basics of Wally Jay's Small-Circle Jujitsu method. Remember that a book is not a teacher. Lets start with saying that the man knows his stuff and can turn even the simplest tweak of the finger into a painfully mind-numbing experience. The book has lots of easily followed photos and explanation to the techniques. Covered in the text are Preliminary exercises:the art of falling, movement and resuscitation techniques. A chapter on the weaknesses of the human body does then follow. Now techniques are explored including wrist and finger locks, arm/leg bars, arm/leg locks, throwing techniques and choker holds. The final chapter concerns us with self defense techniques.Overall I rate this book as worthwhile especially to the grappling student. One failing is that the techniques look on paper rather static and the self defence applications are very basic, but remember the basics are to be built upon and practised. The techniques shown inflict pain and fast. Enjoy!",book
1799,"Small-Circle Jujitsu is the best pocket jj book on the market and also the closest book to traditional, real, ju jutsu. The photos are good (black and white), but the quality of paper can be better (maybe in next edition). All you need for to begin train is in this book.",book
1800,I found this book to be very well authored. It shows what you need to know and gives a very detailed method of teaching you the same technique. Though I think the overuse of wrist locks to be inneffective the overall method is great and proven in competition by wally jay and his students (see the history provided in the book),book
1801,"I Like this book. I think that is great for introduction to Jujitsu as well as a supplementing reference to jujitsu for one who is already practicing the martial art. The techniques covered in the book do work for appropriate situations. While no martial art is so complete as to deal with every conflict situation in which one may find oneself, Small Circle Jujitsu offers a good range of techniques to deal with many common assault scenarios. Small Circle Jujitsu Offers the defender the potential advantage of achieving control over an attacker with minimum effort and an option of not causing injury to attacker once he has been subdued. Karate, Kung Fu, and Boxing do not have these optional advantages.All the technigues are labled, described and explained in english as opposed to many other books which label techniques in Japanese. I think that this serves well the beginning student of Jujitsu who may know nothing of Japanese language or culture; but may still want to learn an efficient means of self defense. I suspect that the use of Japanese terminology in an English culture might even intimidate many prospective Jujitsu students from ever taking up the martial art simply because they cannot even pronounce the words.The book itself is divided into 5 chapters. Beginning students should pay attention to the rules of safety included towards the front of the book. This is because some of the techniques can cause serious injury.Topics covered in the book include falls, exercises, resuscitation, weak points of the body, wrist locks, finger locks, arm bars, arm locks, leg locks, throwing techniques, chokes, as well as defenses against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs.The explanations and pictures of techniques are easy to follow and understand.I think one of the things that make this book such a good value is because the reader also has the option of buying a series of videos and DVD's by the same title and author which show the student the motion and application of smooth, continous transition of techniques which cannot be captured by still pictures and explanatory text. The DVD's can be played back in slow motion which is a learning advantage in any sport. The VHS videos and DVD's can be bought from Amazon.com or direct from Black Belt Magazine at WWW.Blackbeltmag.com.Videos and DVD's can be bought separately or as a complete set. Black Belt Magazine sometimes offers the whole set of 5 VHS tapes or DVD's at the price of 4 tapes or DVD's. Look for the offer if interested.I give this book and the videos 5 each stars because it is evident that Professor Wally Jay really invested much time and effort into making sure that students will be able to understand and make use of the contents of the book and videos of Small Circle Jujitsu as a means of an efficient and effective means of self defence.Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 1 - FoundationsSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 3 - Grappling TechniquesSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and ArmlocksNihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 1Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 2Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 5Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-DefenseChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12",book
1802,"Not a bad book, but like many judo & jujutsu books, it takes a sort of ""technique catalog"" approach, as opposed to a tactical or principles-based approach. Yes, there is some discussion of theory/tactics, but it is not really integrated with the demonstrated techs.May be a good reference book for Danzan/Kodenkan beginners.",book
1803,"Good book. Mostly pictures, and no B.S. He just lays out the techniques, and that's it. Inset pictures show grips for clarity. Not crystal clear, but with any training you get it.",book
1804,"This is the definitive piece on Small Circle Jujitsu, written by its founder. Professor Jay's personal philosophy pervades this martial art. It is simple, direct, strong but effortless...like it's Grand Master. As there is no question that the techniques when applied inflict severe pain, however, it is actually how little pain is required to make an attacker yield that is the true spirit of this art. Finesse rather than raw power is the underlying greatness in Small Circle Jujitsu. Every dedicated student of any martial arts should have this book in their libary.",book
1805,"This book is excellent as a companion to the DVD series. Short and to the point in the text and plenty of technical demonstration pictures. I generally would not recommend such a book, but with the DVD series as a companion, it makes a lot of sense and its a quick reference to have in the Dojo. Recommended for those interested in Jujitsu and Judo. Remember that many of these techniques are illegal in sports competitions.",book
1806,"Got this book on the recommendation from one of my Instructors and it has help me better understand the techniques and application of what I have been learning during my training. If you need a reference or teaching aid book, then you should definitely get this book.",book
1807,"I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.",book
1808,"Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique.",book
1809,"Wally Jay's small circle Jujitsu is a must have for all Jujitsu practitionners. You do'nt have to practice the same style, but you can take ideas and concepts from Wally Jay's small circle Jujitsu and apply them to your martial arts style.Excellent book for those into Jujitsu and wrestling martial arts in general.",book
1810,This book is more useful as training reference for a Small-Circle Jujitsu practioner as while the principle of the small circle is quite interesting and so is Wally Jay's history the book really doesn't cover many principals of grappling in depth.The best books to get to understand the grappling arts isThe Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and TechniquesandTotal Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)as these books go into the details and strategy of grappling arts where as this book is more for advanced practioners.,book
1811,The book has great instruction and drills. It is good for those who have a solid foundation with joint locks and submissions and an overall solid grasp of the body and movement. It has given some good variations of techniques I already teach and use.,book
1812,"As a Marine Corps Close Combat Instrtuctor, I can tell you that the majority of these techniques work well, and may be learned and applied by anyone. I do, however, beleive that much practical application and sparring/grappling against many different opponents is necessary to become proficient in any fighting art. Nearly ALL of the Marine Corps Close Combat techniques are found in this book. As our system was a collaboration of many SME's (subject matter experts), that has to speak for something. In addition, Wally echos one of my main points to my students, do not ever become subbornly commited to one technique. You must be able to flow from one to another based partly upon your skill, but primarily the actions of your opponent. Great book, although the pictures and descriptions could be better for beginning practitioners. If you are familiar with basic Jiu-jitsu techniques and principles, you should have no problems.",book
1813,"Wally Jay is an original, as well as a Hall of Fame martial arts instructor. This book must be one of the 5 or 10 best martial arts books available. It includes 11 wrist locks, 7 finger locks, 10 arm locks, 5 leg locks, 17 throws, 11 chokes, and 45 self defense moves against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs, and arm bars. The step by step explanations are clear, and the large photos are helpful. All you need is a willing partner and you are well on your way to learning Wally Jay's awesome fighting system based on a simple twist of the wrist.",book
1814,"Most of us who study martial arts will never, whether we want to admit it or not, find ourselves in a life-or-death, kicking-and-punching fight. Those who do will probably only do so once or twice in a lifetime. However, much more common is the ""tense situation,"" where someone begins to get out of hand and you need to calm or subdue them without escalating the level of violence. When your uncle gets drunk at the family barbecue and starts horsing around, for example, you can't punch his teeth out. It just isn't done.I studied small-circle ju jitsu for several years as a suppliment to Wado Ryu karate, and I have used it to defuse several tense situations. It works well, and without any of the spiritual mumbo jumbo associated with aikido. The falling and rolling techniques are even more useful, especially if you are a skiier or a mountain biker and, like me, fall down a lot. Wally Jay's book is a great reference. The techniques are effective, the explanations are clear, and the photos are all of good quality.It should be emphasized that this is a reference, not a complete set of lessons. If you have no previous martial arts training or are not part of a dojo, you can't learn ju jitsu from any book. If, however, you are an instructor and want to suppliment your class with this material, this is an excellent sourcebook to work from.",book
1815,"This book is filled with technique, but most importantly, the techniques biuld on the principles presented in the beggining of the book. The small-circle idea is one of the most universaly effective in martial arts, specifically grappling. The book starts off with a short history of SCJJ, and included the principles behind it. It then goes into preleminaries, basic excersises for practicing any JJ style, really, and included breakfalls, art-specific movements, and resuscitation. The next chapter is on weak points of the body, which is an eye-opener. Who knew the cuticle was a pressure point? Prof. Jay then goes into the techniques themselves, and the specific self-defense situations. The variety of moves in this book allow you to chose the level of force you use, and all the holds/throws end in a standing possition, so that one can leave the scene, if desired. I have no real complaints about this book, although I wish the principles were explained in more detail, and most judo books can better explain the throws. Also, all the work is done in gis, so most of the throws, as presented, require a jacket, as do most chokes. This book appears written specifically with self-defence in mind, and in that it succeeds, but those involved in sporting events that use submissions will find it useful as well. Buy it for the principles and holds.",book
1816,"This is an excellent brief work on Prof. Jay's system. Although the book is comparatively short, at least 50 and probably more like 100 techniques are shown. Techniques are divided between throws, wrist locks, elbow locks, leglocks, and finger locks. Vulnerable areas of the body and how to attack them are shown also.Another nice feature is Prof. Jay discusses his overall theory of jujitsu and mechanical and martial principles involved, of which there are 10, which he goes into in some detail. Some of these will not be new to any experienced martial artist, such as the importance of balance, but others, such as his push-pull method of doing holds and locks, may be new.Of course one can't learn a martial art from a book, but if you have some previous knowledge, this book is an excellent introduction and/or review of many of the techniques in Prof. Jay's system. The system I practice has enough overlap so that I found this book a great way to reference and learn somemore about it. I've also had the opportunity to attend two of Prof. Jay's seminars over the years, and would like to say they were great as I expected, and it was a honor to finally meet and get to learn from such a great teacher. And he has put a lot of that knowledge into this book.",book
1817,"As student who intergrates small circle in my Discipline, I would recommend this book to all martial artist. Professor Jays 10 principles and wrist techniques leave you in a AW. The finger lock techinques works wonder no matter how big or small one is. This book is a must have.",book
1818,"This book is great! It shows several techniques using Wally Jay's Small-Circle theory that work effectively and can be learned quickly. This book is great for people who have experience in the fighting arts or for people who don't. The techniques are clearly described with easy-to-follow, step-by-step illustrations. I highly recommend this book, one of the best martial arts books I've read!!",book
1819,"I became interested in learning about Jujitsu when I watched Royce Gracie for the first time in the Ultimate Fighting Championships. My interest was sparked even more when I saw Rickson Gracie's video &quot;Choke&quot;. DO NOT buy this book if you expect to learn the techniques that the Gracies use, because this is a very different style. The book does not deal with any kind of ground fighting...it is strictly stand up combat with a few throws. A lot of the moves would be very difficult to perfect without a partner to practice on, so be sure that you have someone that you can train with.",book
1820,"No book could ever hope to be capable enough to deliver the knowledge and expertise that Professor Wally Jay holds. This book is marginal at best at attempting to impart the knowledge of such an expert as Wally Jay. The book is published in a style popular in the 1970's by karate publications, in that it is presented via numerous black &amp; white photos demonstrating techniques. The book is an acceptable text to those individuals who are already acquainted with Jujitsu and its concepts, for the novice it is somewhat more difficult to comprehend the techniques. I have attended seminars presented by Prof. Jay and know him to be one of the best martial artist living today and a great instructor with a hell of a personality. Maybe, thats why I am some what disappointed with the quality of the book, there are much better books available to those interested in martial arts, jujitsu, or self defense than this one. If you are a student of small circle jujitsu then you should own this book. I hope someday soon another more informative book is published by this truely talented and gifted instructor",book
1821,"I did not find what I was looking for here. I was hoping to find an entire book on ""Small Circle JuJitsu"" and instead found a book that was 80-90% standard Kodenkan JuJitsu at maybe the Shodan Level and only 10-20% of what I would consider ""Small Circle JuJitsu"". I was 20% satisfied and left feeling empty. Maybe I just lack the experience to understand what his two books convey? But I don't think so!",book
1822,I bought it before I knew anything. Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free.,book
1823,"I would like to say that I admire any one who puts in the time and effort to learn a martial art and master it. That takes a lot of dedication and hard work. So I really have a great deal of respect for Wally Jay. Having said that though, I think small circle Jujitsu is really an ineffective grappling system. And I also think that it is no good in the street. Reading this book confirmed all of my worst suspicions about this art. Buy it only if you are looking for a good laugh and have money to burn. If not, and you actually want a good book about fighting try anything in Kid Peligro's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu series. Or go buy some Mario Sperry Vale Tudo tapes. Just don't get this book!",book
1824,"This book does a good job of explaining in print, what Wally Jay demonstrates so well in person. Its the principle of creating leverage. Basically creating on a joint a lever fulcrum situation that can cause pain and discomfort.",book
1825,This book has good pictures and some really good moves. The author improved upon certain moves to make them more effective. Overall a good book.,book
1826,"I am proud to say that I was personally acquainted with Wally Jay thanks to the introduction by former Canadian National Karate Champion, Patrick McCarthy. Later, I was fortunate enough to have hosted several of Jay's seminars and produced an article or two about him for national martial arts magazines. Besides being a talented martial artist Wally Jay was a decent and kind man. In fact, he had once told me that if we injured our opponents in a fight then we have an obligation to take care of them. As a combat veteran and tournament fighter I had trouble with that concept then. Over the years I have come to see that perhaps that's another side of his wisdom and compassion that as an instructor he tried to pass along to those of us knuckle draggers who hadn't caught on that fighting was more than just about belts and trophies.When he was working on this book he asked if I would help out and I agreed. I had nothing really to contribute or add but was honored that he had asked. Having been in the mixed martial arts for over 40 years and written hundreds of articles for martial arts and military publications I can honestly say that Professor Wally Jay was truly one of best people I met along the way. His passing was a tremendous loss to the martial arts world but his soul and spirit live on in this book.As for those critics who think any one book will teach you to be a real fighter...well, maybe if you study what's in it and then perhaps if you will also give it 20 or so years of work on the mat fighting against good opponents from any and every fighting style or martial art.",book
1827,great as a review book - love the many pics of techniques similar to zujitsu; master zulu's re-developed style of jujitsu.,book
1828,Jay Sensei is a martial arts living treasure and his book provides a great deal of useful instruction. The yubi waza section alone is worth the cost of the book.,book
1829,"Ok, I have studied martial arts for 11 years now, (feb 2000), I have met and studied under Prof Jay in multiple seminars. This book does have some very good techniques in it, but it is also flawed in that it doesn't tell you how to apply them on a person fighting them. As far as techniques go, there are many that would never work on a live,resisting opponent, but many many more that could be made to work. you can pick up the tech's from this book, but after you get the basic mechanics down, you'll need to get a partner and practice moves in a more real environment. IE have him react when he attacks you, don't just have him grab you and stand there like an idiot,have him grab you, then throw a punch at you, or grab you and jerk you around etc. Then you get to see what tech's can work and what can't.",book
1830,"I think this is an excellent book on self defense where you'll really need it...close up. I've been studying martial arts for almost 3 years and I don't believe that you need physical self defense when the other person is more than an leg's length away (unless they have a gun, but that's a different concept). When a cousin gave me an Amazon gift certificate, I decided to buy a book on the martial arts. I ended up buying two books (The other book is a different approach to this topic and is the best of it's kind that I've ever seen, but it's not available at Amazon... . Wally Jay's book, &quot;Small-Circle JuJitsu&quot;, is filled with excellent, stop-action photos which help you learn the moves needed to do what's being taught. There aren't many words in this book but the ones that are there are well choosen! It's a very effective style, both the teaching and the martial art. This is one of the few(!) books (along with &quot;Uechi-Ryu 2000&quot;) I can reccomend with a clear conscience.",book

1833,This was a very impressive tale covering three generations of women of different classes in the history of El Salvador. Even if you have never been to that country nor know a lot of the history the story is gripping. The relations between the various women are beautifully drawn and are good and interesting enough to overcome the sometimes tedious effort to tell the history of the country. The book contains many jewels of small and simple things people do for and with each other. The letter of Caecilia at the end of the book is an example of absolute literary beauty and I will not forget that scene for a long time.In the best traditions of Isabel Allende and G.G.Marquez. A book which I not only enjoyed reading but one that I will give friends as a present.,book
1834,"I read with interest this book and was glued to my seat. I fell in love with the country and the characters and Benitez is a master story teller. I was a little disappointed that I did not have more information about the civil war, but if you read between the lines you will live the struggle of the Salvadorian people.",book
1835,"I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the ""telenovela"" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots.",book
1836,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book since it came so highly recommended by a trusted book catalogue. On the positive side, the book gives an interesting account of the historical struggle between the rich coffee plantation owners and the uprising of the poor Indian workers. However, the author fails, in my opinion, in developing her characters beyond the superficial, and thus I remained uninvolved for the most part and detached from all the human tragedies. In summary, Ms Benitez had a wonderful premise for a story, and the history and description of El Salvador are enlightening and in part very beautiful, but the plot and characters ultimately remain shallow and mimick the sub-plot soap opera.",book
1837,I wish I had more time to write a review worthy of this book! I will say that this book is fulfilling and rich read. The stories of the women and their families in this book provide insight into the contrast of the social classes in El Salvador in times past. The very personal stories allow the reader to connect with the characters while learning a great deal about the history of El Salvador from the 1930's on.,book
1838,"Bitter grounds, coffee, a harvest many of us crave and one who many in the land of the Savior or El Salvador depend upon as Sandra Benitez tells us in her three generation saga, Bitter Grounds. This richly textured American Book Award Winner, is a sort of rich man, poor man, upstairs, downstairs, set in El Salvador from 1932 through 1977.It is a compelling read and Sandra Benitez grabs the reader and transports her to El Salvador with the first sentence:""The parakeets ascened in a rustling roar of wings from the amate and primavera trees. Chattering rowdily, they hailed the rising sun. They flew toward the southern sea cresting in a line of shimmering foam tha broke and then evanesced along the black volcanic shore. The birds wheeled, banking in a long graceful turn before heading back over the forest they had roosted in; they soared toward breakfast in maicillo fields twenty kilometers away. Jabbering, the birds glided and dipped over the alluvial plain furrowed by rivers and streams coming down from the highlands. Across the plain, they trailed a hasty shadow over squares of cattle ranches and rectangles of scattered farms; they sailed past the spot where four hundred years before, don Pedro de Alvarado and his conquistadores defeated the mighty arm of the Pipil. But such a victory exacted its toll for in the fierce skirmish, Alvarado took an arrow in the leg, a wound from which he would never recover.""And that wound to the leg portends the history of the characters which inhabit Bitter Grounds. Sandra Benitez fleshes out her heroines of each generation, Elena and Mercedes, Magda and Jacinta and Florencia and Maria Mercedes. All are strong and vulnerable, wise and foolish and all are haunted by decisions that will shape their paths and those who follow them.The familiar structure of the family saga worked well to bring an understanding of the mid-twentieth century history of El Salvador. Sandra Benitez, skillfully fleshed out the intricacies of the culture, the economy and social structure of the country for a reader unfamiliar with it can gain understanding and insight, while at the same time entertaining with a wonderful story. She infused her story gracefully with small elements of magic realism which inhabit many books by Latin American authors.I would not hesitate to pick up another book by this author.",book
1839,"After reading this book I knew I needed to share it. So I shared it with a friend, who shared it with a friend, who shared it with a friend. . . and I have now bought my fifth copy as I still want to share this, and those who read it want to share it as well.A wonderful story of 3 generations of women. Their stories are ones you will want to share with the universe.Buy it. Read it. Share it.",book
1840,"Having cherished A Place Where the Sea Remembers, I was eager to read Bitter Grounds and glad that it was so much longer. I was not disappointed. This is a powerful book, reminiscent of In the Time of Butterflies by Julia Alvarez, yet still a story that stands on its own. To say I was moved is an understatement. The lives of Benitez' characters are once more irrevocably intertwined and fascinating as they face the challenges of a life in El Salvador in times of military and political injustice. The strength of Benitez' women is exemplary. I highly recommend this book, one from which I take another set of priceless friends. Brava!",book
1841,I have just finished reading this book not 20 minutes ago and I can not see a day in the future where the story will be forgotten. My heart is aching and the book moved me to tears. The characters are a permanent part of me now and I haven't been able to sleep well the past few nights as I read this book. The story will haunt you especially when you remember that though it is fiction it is very much based on true happenings such as la mantaza and the civil war.El Salvador is a beautiful country with many man-made conflicts and the book depicts that as true and honest as can be told. It opened my eyes to both sides of the conflict and told stories that many Salvadorans still hold deep down not wishing to ever speak about again.,book
1842,"This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think.",book
1843,"the book was in the condition promised as was its delivery. but the content was extroindary. what a story, im suprised noone recommened this book to me sooner. a rich unrelenting dark read that covers everything a good book needs. love,mystery,sorrow,history sex, upstairs downstairs intrigue. this book will stay with me for a long time. it told me a story i never knew of so. america, and i am sorry for that",book
1844,"I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!",book
1845,"My bookclub decided to read this book as a follow-up to the non-fiction From Grandmothers to Granddaughters by Michael Gorkin that follows 3 generations of Salvadoran women through the civil war and into the 90's. This book was an excellent fictional follow-on. It follows the paths of 3 generations of one lower class family and one upper class family through the turbulent 20th Century in El Salvador. Benitez does not hesitate to share the gory details of Salvador's turbulent history from 1933-1977.I found the book very easy to become engrossed in, despite my dislike of violence and blood-drenched descriptions. Her descriptions of life in El Salvador are true to life in every detail. I live in San Salvador and found myself searching for &quot;Tresores&quot; or the carjacking spot on the road to La Libertad in Santa Tecla.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in what it is like to live in this country, what the Salvadoran people have experienced, or who just wants a beautiful, albeit sad, story of human survival in adversity.",book
1846,"As a big fan of Sandra Benitez's A Place Where the Sea Remembers I eagerly looked forward to reading Bitter Grounds. What I found was a very different book although equally as satisfying and enlightening. As in A Place Where the Sea Remembers Sandra's intoxicating lyrical style leaves an indelible mark on you as you read Bitter Grounds. But in this story I felt myself being pulled much deeper into the lives of the families whose existence is inextricably connected to El Salvador's politics and coffee trade. Moving quickly, the story covers many miles, tragedies and celebrations and suddenly you're at the end-not quite ready to leave, and never able to forget the rich stories within the story. A wonderful journey and well worth the read!",book
1847,"Having been born in El Salvador in the same year as Bitter Grounds' last two heroines, I can say that this book is a rarety: one which combines truth and fiction and lays bare the soul of a people caught in tragedy and turmoil. I was mesmerized by the details of life the author chronicled concerning day to day life in San Salvador and Santa Ana, by the intimate details which revealed so much about the two worlds which exist side by side in this tiny, bustling country. Coming from a family in which my father was a self made man, ultimately the highest ranking diplomat from El Salvador and in which my mother was part of the landed aristocracy of Santa Ana, I was amazed at how Ms. Benitez was able to weave so many weighty subjects into her story and yet emerge with a fable for the ages. Had I remained in El Salvador, I wonder on which side of the fence I would have landed: Maria Mercedes' or Flor's. My father's humble beginnings pulled me one way, my mother's the other. Growing up eventually in the U. S. made that choice unnecessary, but still my roots pull at me, and this book has unlocked memories I didn't even know I had.I thank Ms. Benitez for enriching my world with her novel of times that were, times that could have been, times of unrivaled tragedy and sadness. It is the story of El Salvador.",book
1848,I really like the way Sandra Benitez writes. It is the first of her books I read and was nice to see the combination of reality and fiction. A fiction novel based on a reality that darkened the beautiful country of El Salvador.,book
1849,"Author Sandra Benitez wraps readers up tightly in the tale of a poor family and a rich family tied to El Salvador's coffee plantations, but don't get too cozy: the terrors imposed by gov't forces as well as the guerrilla soldiers lurks somewhere on the pages ahead. The story follows pairs of mothers and daughters caught between passion and politics.The author grew up in the 50s in El Salvador and was a witness to the heartbreak of illiterate women who left villages and families behind to find work in the capital. Then, in the 70s, as friends and family became targets of the growing revolution, she experienced firsthand the repercussions of oppression. This is a powerful book, one that will stay with readers long after they've turned the last page and turned off the reading lamp.",book
1850,"This is a truly deep view of El Salvador's soul and the elements that pushed this tiny country into a civil war. Poor and rich are seen through the eyes of a sensible woman --Sandra Benitez-- who spent her childhood in El Salvador. It's very rich, moving and awakens social feelings. It's maybe because I am Salvadorean that I have enjoyed it so much. Still, it's a pretty good book even if all you know about El Salvador is the slanted headlines you saw in the U.S. media during the eighties. There's good and bad in El Salvador, and this is a good book to learn about what made its people go into a painful war. It's a good and entertaining read as well.",book
1851,"I always wanted to get around to reading Ambrose Bierce. Known as an iconoclast and an excellent satirist, Bierce is best known for his Devil's Dictionary. He's also known for the disappearing act he pulled in Mexico in 1913. I decided to give this short anthology a chance. If I liked his stories, I figured I'd buy some more of his writings. I will be reading more of his writings.The recent movie _The Blair Witch Project_ has brought scary stories back into vogue. After reading this book, I realized you can make a direct connection from this film to Ambrose Bierce. The connection would pass through Stephen King and H.P.Lovecraft along the way. I've seen things in both of these writers that could have been lifted directly out of one of Bierce's stories. In Bierce's story, &quot;The Damned Thing&quot;, with its talk about colors that can and can't be seen, I could have sworn I was reading Lovecraft. Bierce is a master at quick twists and shocking violence, and delivers scares fast and furious. I got chills with several of these short stories, which certainly makes for good horror reading.The book gives the reader a sample of Bierce's short stories. Most of the stories are tied around American Civil War themes, which is no surprise as Bierce served in the Union army during that conflict. His experiences gave him the necessary frame of reference to write these dark stories. And when I say dark, I mean DARK! Some of these tales will make your jaw drop. The violence in them is extremely unsettling. Chickamauga and Oil of Dog are sickening, describing blown open heads and dead babies in graphic detail.Did I mention Bierce's prose? Some of the best you'll read. His prose is so amazing that I found myself rereading some of his passages just so I could make sure I was getting the full meaning. It is that rich and textured. It's also extremely funny in places. In the introduction it is written that Bierce lived in England for several years and was embraced by the English, who are masters not only of the language, but also insults. I'm not surprised when I look at how he writes. He can pen an insult that would bring tears of joy to an Englishman's eyes.Finally, Bierce's stories show incredible depth for the short story format. He ridicules false courage, irony, lawyers, and even unions in the story, &quot;The Revolt of the Gods&quot;. I highly recommend that anyone not familiar with Ambrose Bierce give this book a read. It reads fast and you'll laugh and be shocked within the space of one page. Good stuff.",book
1852,"Ambrose Bierce's collected stories, mostly of the Civil War but also of peacetime America in the last half of the 19th Century, are amazing not least because of the fact that he was one of the first to write in this genre. No doubt much of his inspiration for his Civil War stories were based upon his own observations as an officer in the Union Army while other stories may have been ones he came up with while living on the Pacific coast.Ghostly occurances, strange machines, unexplained episodes, monsters... Bierce seems to have lived in a strange world of shadows all his own. It is somehow fitting that Bierce simply disappeared in the early 20th Century.Great book. Definitely a classic.",book
1853,"This book is filled with information about African-Americans and their accomplishments that every person should know. Do you know which U.S. President established the Office of Minority Affairs? Who was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D.? What state east of the Mississippi was the first to give African-American women the right to vote, in 1913? These are just some of the questions you'll find in this volume. I especially liked having each set of answers on the same page as the questions. The author also includes a helpful bibliography for further study. Highly Recommended.",book

1857,"In the Dark Places of Wisdom is one of the most insightful and well-written books I have ever read. It is a story of historical intrigue backed by tangible artifacts told in a fast paced, yet surprisingly soft and mystical light. I couldn't put it down.Some of the western hypnotized reviewers here obviously don't understand the profound knowledge that enriched the great ancient cultures. Its decline led to the horrendous Dark Ages where almost all learning was lost. But few ask why. Scholar and author, Peter Kingsley, ponders this question and shows us a bigger picture. He knows his history and esotericism like few others. In the spirit of the true Greek philosophers Kingsley poetically explains where rationality went wrong and subtly encourages the reader to consider a deeper meaning of life. It is no wonder hard cold rationalists feel their ego threatened by the revelations in this book.If you are myopic in your view of history, and believe myth and folklore are just silly stories, and that anything that came before us must be more primitive, then don't bother to read this book - you won't get it anyway. But if you are beginning to think with your heart as well as your mind, and dare to imagine a history, indeed a future, more beautiful than brain alone allows, then you will love this book. Like a sacred site, ""Dark Places of Wisdom"" not only conveys unspoken knowledge, it awakens a higher reality.Kudos to Kingsley!",book
1858,"This is a fairly short book, and can be read in one or two sittings. It is very easy to read, and sort of enjoyable. On the down side, this author spends too much time trying to vilify Plato and Aristotle, resorting to a very unlikely idea that they conspired to bury Parmenides' ideas, and/or make it look like Plato was his true heir, rather than Zeno. As other reviewers of this book have pointed out, they would have had no motive to do so. Since this book is so short and easy, what the author could have done is spend a lot more time supporting his ideas rather than just stating them as fact without convincing evidence. Or better yet, he could have chosen to just focus on the mystical importance of Parmenides' writings and just avoid the conspiracy theory and trying to rewrite history altogether. This is where I have the most sympathy for the author: I believe he may indeed understand Parmenides' writing from a mystical point of view, and in some ways this is why his writing style is passionate. For this reason I almost gave this book three stars; but I couldn't do this because this isn't the only book about the underworld initiation or ""dying before you die""; and yet the author almost acts like it is or like he's discovered something nobody else has. If passionate and mystical, the author's style could also be described as lurid. He almost seems to act as if the discoveries are too amazing to be believed, narrating as if he's telling a children's story by continually using rhetorical questions like ""And you know what they found next?"". He suggests on one hand that people of european descent who are interested in the east are neglecting their own heritage, and then claims that we are indebted to the east and there is a conspiracy trying to cover that up. Actually, every book I've ever read on Greek Philosophy states that the Greeks took significant portions of their ideas from the east. At one point he mentions a memorial (constructed about 500 years after Parmenides was alive) of Parmenides which gives him a title that fits with his theory, yet when he points out that the face couldn't have been Parmenides' (on a statue of Parmenides) but it was a generic face, he overlooks that. In other words, he uses the evidence when it fits his theory, and excuses it when it doesn't. The people who constructed the memorial could have been mistaken about his title and it's implications since it was centuries after he lived. I think that if he focused on writing a book of mystical importance, rather than getting caught up trying to overthrow the establishment philosophers and rewrite history, he'd create something a lot better. He seems to forget that Plato also, was a mystic, and had received the underworld initiation. Even though universities focus mainly on Plato's secular writings, his mystical and esoteric writings are there. I still feel like I want to read this author's other books, if for no other reason than because they are kinda fun, and to write another critique.",book
1859,"I first read Kingsley's books almost 5 years ago. It was life-changing. Every time I re-read In the Dark Places of Wisdom, in particular, I'm taken back to that electric excitement, that freshness and wonder of tremendous discovery. It's true, what the other reviewers say, this book reads like a mystery novel, a whodunit. Awe and urgency come through on every page.In the Dark Places of Wisdom is not an easy read, but not for the reasons you might expect. I think it's because we, as a culture, are drowning in our own sensationalism. If you turn on the TV for half an hour, you'll see what's totally trivial and inane presented as momentous and earth-shattering. When we do finally encounter a real discovery, it can be extremely hard to accept. We're jaded. But that doesn't mean that great discoveries don't exist anymore. Kingsley's research is meticulous and impeccable. If you care to look, it will become harder and harder to escape his conclusions.And then, when you wrap your mind around what's in this book and see the implications, you'll find that it's anything but a light read. You will probably find it, as I did, both profoundly unnerving and utterly thrilling. It's such a surreal experience to discover that everything you've always taken for granted about your civilization is wrong. And it's nothing short of magical to find out that the truth is more beautiful, more alive, than you ever could have hoped or imagined. It's like seeing life for the first time. It's like walking into another world. Read this book. Your heart will thank you.",book
1860,"This book reads like a mystery story, or rather a story aboutmystery. It is based on solid academic scholarship, but is by no meanswritten in an academic style. Rather, it is a highly personal account of the author's discoveries about a famous Greek philosopher, Parmenides, and the philosopher's surprising secret. A philosopher whom thousands of years of academic scholarship and philosophy regarded as a dry logician, turns out to be the representative of an authentic Mediterranean tradition of mystical practice. Kingsley's writing takes on an almost religious intensity in places; he writes like a man with a vision, trying to awaken those who have suppressed or forgotten their own spiritual connections. DARK PLACES OF WISDOM is something that can transcend the seminars and the classrooms, reaching out to spiritual searchers who are sick of the banalities of our society and are questing for a more direct experience of the divine. According to Kingsley, this is how that quest, and that experience, was done back in the Sicilian colonies of ancient Greece, 2500 years ago. And that tradition that Kingsley discovers, has been hidden in the depths of our Western culture and consciousness ever since. If you want an adventure which is both intellectual AND mystical, try this book. END",book
1861,"Through In The Dark Places of Wisdom, Peter Kingsley covers the roots of the Western system of thought as revealed through the lives of Plato, Pythagoras and Parmeneides. Essentially, the Phoenicians brought eastern spiritual traditions with them when they fled the Persians. Through the methods of `incubation', simply sitting quietly, these Greeks developed the most revelatory discoveries that we accredit to them.In our current rational systems we would instantly discredit anyone bringing `laws from the gods delivered by dreams' but not so in Greek society. The rational faculties we have celebrated in those we attributed early rationality to are heavily misplaced, shaking the foundations of our own systems.Perhaps the most significant failure of current humanity is the inability to experience incubation in our daily lives due to strict schedules. This quiet meditation of the heart is a core aspect of all mystical schools and a severe afterthought in the blueprint for modern existence. Truthfully, philosophy isn't arguing about thoughts or existence, its is the love of wisdom. Mysticism has been relegated to the fringes of culture and the more it gravitates outward, the more we push it away because we have to fill the void with some new substitution. I won't list those substitutions because you know what they are. The ways we avoid the `path to the underworld' undertaken by Parmeneides are numerous. Only by facing the depths of the human existence do we become human. By avoiding the dark side we come to fear it, it manifests as latent dissatisfaction, depression and terror.Sadly, many of us will ""come to the point of our death and find ourselves still wanting the thousand substitutes we aren't able to have"". Kingsley posits, ""...because there's no knowledge left any more of how to find access to what's beyond our waking consciousness, we have to take anesthetics and drugs. And because there's no longer any understanding of powers greater than ourselves we're denied any meaning to our suffering. So we suffer as liabilities, die as statistics."" If that sounds familiar it is because he describes the way we observe the world around us. The promise of reviving methods of subconscious exploration like incubation has significant advantages.""Life for us has become an endless affair of trying to improve ourselves, achieving more and doing more, learning more, always needing to know more things. The process of learning and being taught has simply become a matter of being fed facts and information, receiving what we didn't have before, always being given something different from ourselves. That's what whatever we learn never touches us deeply enough; why we sense this the more we rush around trying to find substitutions for the void we feel inside. Everything pushes us outside ourselves, further away from the simplicity of our humanity. ""Where does the knowledge for growth lie? Inside ourselves: ""We already have everything we need. We just have to be shown what we have. This is why the greatest teachers are often utter nobodies. In some circumstances they might introduce you to a new system of knowledge or change your lifestyle - and yet that's not what their teaching is basically about. It's just a trick to keep your mind focused while the real work is being done somewhere else... we think that being practical means keeping busy, getting on with our lives, rushing from one distraction to another finding more and more substitutes for what we dimly sense.""As Parmeneides said, `human beings wander along, knowing nothing'. What Kingsley effectively argues is that Parmeneides was referring to us. What I took from this book is that the reality before us must be valued for what it is, even if it undermines some of the notions we have about the past and our most intimate nature.",book
1862,"This book is about so much more than what it seems to be. I read this because it was in the bibliography of ""The Apples of Apollo"" by Ruck, Staples, and Heinrich. Don't think for a minute that the wisdom loved by Parmeneides is something you find just by sitting still in a cave. I would not have understood Kingsley's book at all had I not already read the other. I'm sure Kingsley knows exactly what he is doing.",book
1863,"This is an odd and interesting book that has deepened my appreciation for Greek history. Basically, it explores the mystical orientation of many of Greece's greatest thinkers, including Pythagoras and Parmeneides. Most importantly, it shows that in their mystical orientation they were more than &quot;thinkers&quot;. Kingsley explores how Plato sought to change the direction of Greek thought by focussing more on rational thought, a turn away from the experiential spirituality of the earlier philosophers. He explores that experiental spiritual tradition which was &quot;mainstream&quot; prior to Plato's usurpation of it. Kingsley attributes Platonic philosophy's eclipse of this earlier and more deeply rooted tradition to Athenian military beligerence.In our understanding of the history of Greek thought, it sometimes appears that the early portion of that history involved oral myth and inspired poetry, while the latter portion is devoted to liberating man from the superstitions of the past, through rational thought. Kingsley shows us Greek thinkers who understood the value of myth and of exploring the depths of the psyche, for revelation, for healing, for finding wholeness and connection to a realm beyond death, the realm of &quot;heros&quot; who attain immortality through exploration of truth.We don't have a lot of written material attributed to Parmeneides or written about him from reliable witnesses. Therefore, much of this little book contains Kingsley's inspired interpretation and analysis of this limited amount of material, utilizing the considerably greater amount of information we have on the world in which Parmeneides and his peers lived.Some might not like this, but for me it was useful and meaningful that he brought this material to life for me, convincingly.",book
1864,"I found reading Peter Kingsley's ""In the Dark Places of Wisdom"" to be quite frustrating insofar as he writes a great deal without really saying much. The idea behind this book is that there was once great wisdom lost to us as a result of a ""conspiracy"" lasting for over two millennia and perpetrated by western philosophers since the time of Plato. The majority of this book is dedicated to Kingsley's attempts to sort the threads of this lost wisdom, as revealed in some recently found artifacts, back to its source in Parmenides' and Pythagorean philosophy before it was tampered with by the ""conspirators"" including Plato, Aristotle and many others who subverted and corrupted their message which originated in the east. This is all fine and well and at times interesting, but the whole of Parmenides Philosophy as expounded by Kingsley would fill no more than 4 or 5 pages out of the 255 written (I'm being generous here). The rest of the book is devoted to showing how Kingsley has divined the truth coupled with his rather pedantic approach to exposing all Philosophers since Plato as missing what he, and he alone, sees so clearly. Kingsley promises to show us the way back to the essential truths of Parmenides. However, the only practical implications I can draw from this book would be for me to ""lie down in a cave for a few days, eschewing food and distractions of the modern world and `incubate'"". Thereby, in some mysterious way, I will find myself (if I really, really desire it) in the underworld in the company of the Goddess of Truth who will teach me wisdom and the means of filling the void in my inner being. Ah, it would be great if, as Kingsley implies, it were that simple. He ends this book by saying it is the first chapter of a long story so Kingsley may have something substantial in the future to say about Parmenides, the extant fragments of his writings, his philosophy and ecstatic techniques as a shaman and magician which he didn't accomplish this round.",book
1865,"This book simply floors me. Along with his scholarly tour de force Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic, Kingsley is proving himself to be the Wilamowitz, Rohde or Nietzsche of the start of the new millenium. The man knows his sources intimately and has a truly sympathetic and astonishingly wide-ranging grasp of all the relevant material. As a neo-pagan who is at home with greek religious traditions I am so pleased to find a writer who combines solid scholarship with a mystical appreciation of the material he writes about. This book is a steal at twice the price. Buy it! read it and keep it always handy in your library of necessary texts.",book
1866,"the phrase ""missing pieces to a puzzle"" come to mind. the puzzle being our modern western life. really enjoyed this book, and his style of writing.",book
1867,"The Origin is not at all far away. It is eternally Present. This wonderful book apparently tells the story about Parmenides and his lineage, all the while pointing the reader back to this Origin at the Heart of Being. The mystics appear to be the true realists. Enjoy!",book
1868,"Peter Kingsley takes the reader on his documented journey beyond the origin of human ""Thought"" to the place of Embodied Experience.He builds the ""Container"" for the Left Out Wisdom of our Human Experience. Peter inrtoduces us to the Fact that we are Mortal and Emortal and Eternity exists in the space between our ""Conscious"" inhale and exhale.The Dark Places of Wisdom documents what I have known all my Life and did not have the ""Words"" for. I am Eternally Grateful. His book REALITY and CD's Welcome to Eternity are also excellent.Barbara James M.A.",book
1869,"What we have here is an academic paper puffed into a book.If one has the patience to wade through his tedious repetitions, condescensions, ax grinding, and self-congratulations, one is rewarded with the glimmer of a new idea. But that idea, recedes mirage-like, ever into the horizon. I don't know how I ever made it through.It's disappointing that Kingsley fails to locate his work within the context of Ganzfeld parapsychology, or even of Sumer, the source culture of the ancients. I was amused to find that despite what he believes to be his breakthrough insights, he is ignored by other scholars.Nice try, Peter, but you owe us much better. Next time, at the very least, give us a useful table of contents, a readable list of references, and an index.",book
1870,"Peter Kingsley's books are frustrating because they strain and labor to argue against modern-era Philosophy, that prior to the Modern era, Philosophy was originally altered-state based... using cave incubation.Actually he only focuses on the most ancient Greek and Italy Philosophers (Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles), similar to R. Gordon Wasson's limiting of Amanita use in Judeo-Christianity to the period prior to the writing of the Eden tree story on page 2 of the Bible.What's frustrating is that Kingsley doesn't equate or explicitly address that Philosophy was entheogen-based (though he writes amply on the wine-mixing krater as the passageway to the underworld), and that Philosophy remained entheogen-based throughout the entire period prior to the Modern era; he vaguely asserts, but with tremendous, labored fanfare, that the altered state was induced by meditative incubation in caves.The mountain rumbled!, and shook!, and parted! -- and out came a mouse.",book
1871,"I have little to add to either the praise or criticism of this book, as previous reviewers have done both in exhaustive depth. I will say that only one reviewer has mentioned what I thought was one of the more interesting parts of the work: the political backdrop against which the contested events occurred. Philosophy and mysticism do not occur in isolation, and the notion that one view defeats another simply because it is judged to be a 'better' argument is misguided at best. Philosophers are not set apart from society and the body politic, but act within and upon it. The account in this book of the activities of Zeno that lead to his eventual torture and execution are a case in point.",book
1872,"I love this book. It reveals a shamanistic mystical tradition that is our heritage, but has been driven underground for thousands of years. It helped me understand more about the healing process that the human psyche is going through now. Healers and counselors will appreciate this work!",book
1873,"I'll admit it. I never really could warm up to the father of modern wisdom and this book goes a long way toward explaining why.Kingsley is an excellent writer and researcher.His position is very convincing and really does strike at the the heart of this east/west or inner/outer schism. I highly recommended it to anyone with a love of philosophy, even more so to anyone who found it boring.",book
1874,"A tiresome meander through bits & pieces of ancient history and philosophy to try to prove, once again, that there is a great effort to keep humans from realizing their potential and the secret wisdom that was revealed in former times. Dull, pedantic and unfocused.",book
1875,"To find out the facts about how our Western Civilization got it's start and why we are in such trouble. I could write many words that might bore you or TRY to inspire you. But I won't. This is a short book and easy to read book. But don't be fooled by that. It is a very scholarly work that presents us with facts that have been hidden for far too long.You can agree or disagree, but that makes no difference. The evidence seems to stand for itself. I remember when I first discovered Peter Kingsley 3 or 4 years ago. I listened to some of online audios which can be found free of charge and I was immediately drawn to his work, but as I got further into it, I could not continue. I understand why now. I was being challenged. ""Dark places""....really who wants to go into dark places. So ran away for a few years.Peter presents quite a history in just a few chapters. I would recommend anyone to read this book. Especially if you would like to get some insight into our Western civilization, especially if you are attracted at all for any reason to read it, and most especially, if you are ready to be honest with yourself that you truly are being drawn into ""Dark Places"" within yourself. Because if you do, you will be surprised that the Light is not just UP there or floating around in some world of CHI, but the Light...the greatest Light might just be found in the ""Darkness"".I would suggest that you pay close attention to your body sensations as you read. When you read the book you will understand why I suggest that.",book
1876,"I have just read this wonderful book for the second time, and I anticipate moving into Peter's next, Reality. When I first read Dark Places some three years ago, I loved it then, too, but I became a bit nonplussed when I found the author's website with its plea for financial assistance. ""Just another cult,"" figured, and too bad because he truly is a great writer and thinker and perhaps even would-be reformer.I would love to hear more of his personal story. It does sound like he was kicked around a great deal in academia, just another bankrupt institution imho. But that's reading between the lines in Dark Places.Perhaps a great new network is forming that can protect the would-be initiate in these perilous times, the one who must travel from cult to cult (as it would be ""understood"" by the family and institutions he must leave behind). Perhaps mysticism can one day be taught in the public schools.I always wondered why Plato, Aristotle and Athens were considered so great when it all ended so soon in such a bloodbath. I thank Peter Kingsley for showing me a much greater reality behind and beneath that picture.Reason is a wonderful facility, the mind is a fantastic playground and workshop, but something much greater is needed. We are taking ourselves apart, individually and as a society, to put ourselves together again in a much healthier way, and Peter Kingsley is another great writer showing us the necessity.At one of the ""esoteric"" schools in which I studied, reason is given as but one of ""ten qualities of mind."" The other nine are: memory, will, desire, emotion, intuition, creativity, curiosity, consciousness, and conscience. It's easy to see how different cultures and different schools have emphasized one or more of these qualities over the others. Academia, of course, has overemphasized reason. This emphasis has been necessary to lead mankind out from under the power of the church and kings, into the Renaissance and our present day political freedoms. Hopefully now we are ready for another giant step, though it will not occur without conflict.",book
1877,"Until I read this book, I thought philosophy was boring. I thought that there was no way for me to really understand the ancient Greeks. It seems like everything that I learned about them in school was dusty and tired. Their mythology was no more than a bunch of immortal clowns constantly creating scandals and dragging mortals intio their own grudges. It's hard to find anything spiritual about tales of adultery and malice.In this book I discovered that there is a lot lost in our narrow modern understanding of this mythology. Apollo is suddenly a dynamic character. He is the father of both science and mysticism. In his hands the two blend together as though they are one. He is also the representation of eternal youth and eternal life. I came away with a spiritual understanding and a much greater respect for the fore fathers of our medical practice and our society.You need this book.",book
1878,"Like other reviewers, I found Kingsley's style irritating and almost condescending, as though he were an explorer of great experience and wisdom trying to convey something of the sense of wonder to people who are not very capable of understanding specifics. However, he did hit upon one thing that is VERY important -- but I see no sign that he himself understood what it meant.Kingsley talks about the iatromantis guiding people lying in dark caves - and seems to think it has something to do with them preparing themselves for their eventual death. But I don't think it was that at all. When I read that I thought, ""these people are doing what we did at the Monroe Institute - depriving the senses of input to make it easier to concentrate on inner images so that they could learn to experience and use unusual mental states at will."" I expect they went through specific exercises in those dark spaces, probably accompanied with some rhythmic background sound, as shamanism uses.Kingsley is perhaps too enmeshed in the academic mindset to realize that these people were having a real experience that we today can share. Of course my guess may be wrong, but it is part of the value of Kingsley's book that it gives rise to just such speculations.I give it a one for style and a 5 for content, so the result is a three.",book
1879,"I'd give this book 5 stars for content, especially if, like me, you are interested in PreSoratic philosophy and in this era when mysticism and philosophy were joined at the hip - a far healthier situation than the secular schizophrenic ""Exluded Middle"".However on writing style, I'd have to go with 2 and a half stars as Kingsley grinds his axe on every page and is often over anxious to turn the account into a thriller. If it wasn't for the fact that he was an Honorary Professor, one might believe this work is nothing more than an attempt to pander to conspiracy theorist audiences. But he is obviously highly passionate about the topic and his credentials secure the knowledgable research that the book is based on.",book
1880,"This book is wonderful when it comes to explaining the proem (that is, the introductory part) of Parmenides' poem. I always thought there might have been a strong religious component to Parmenides' thought. However, the book is considerably less valuable when it comes to relating the proem to the other two parts of the poem. What does the descent into Tartarus tell us about the Way of Truth? What does it tell us about Parmenides' claims that only one thing exists and that we cannot speak of what is not? Dr. Kingsley doesn't give us much to go on.Even worse is his account of the influence of Parmenides. This is partly taken, uncritically, from other scholars. He borrows the ridiculous view of Mitchell H. Miller, Jr., that Plato insulted Zeno in the dialogue called the Parmenides because he wanted himself rather than Zeno to be known as the rightful heir of Parmenides' ideas. Plato was too much of a philosopher to act in such a way. If he had a problem with Zeno's philosophy, he would have attacked it head on. Anyway, insulting Zeno was hardly sufficient for this purpose because PARMENIDES HAD ANOTHER STUDENT. Everyone knows that Melissus was also an heir to Parmenides' philosophy. If Plato wanted the world to think that he was the true heir to Parmenides, he was going to have to insult both Zeno and Melissus, which he didn't do.Dr. Kingsley is also mistaken about Plato having &quot;killed&quot; the broader concept of what a philosopher is supposed to be, which Parmenides accepted. According to Kingsley, Parmenides believed that a philosopher should be a sort of shaman (or an Iatromantis, to use the technical term), but because Plato killed this notion in his dialogue the Sophist, it is now difficult for us to understand this earlier concept of the philosopher. First, it seems strange that someone who wanted to show himself to be the true heir of a predecessor should be so anxious to kill one of the ideas of that predecessor. Second, the basic point that Plato attacked in the Sophist (beginning at 237a) was a statement made by Parmenides that Kingsley never mentions: &quot;Never shall this be proved, that things that are not are.&quot; This statement comes from Parmenides' Way of Truth (not the proem), and Plato focused exclusively on the Way of Truth when he &quot;killed&quot; Parmenides. He never bothered discussing the proem at all. Nor did he bother to discuss the concept of the philosopher as a shaman.Furthermore, people before Plato had just as effectively &quot;killed&quot; Parmenides. Take the sophist Protagoras, for example, who lived after Parmenides but before Plato. According to one ancient source, Protagoras wrote a book (now lost) containing a refutation of Parmenides. This was long before Plato had &quot;killed&quot; him in the Sophist. But not only did Protagoras refute Parmenides, he also became so famous that Parmenides was left in the dust. Anyone who reads Plato's dialogue the Protagoras should be able to see this. Worst of all, Protagoras was not an Iatromantis, anymore than Plato was; instead, he was a teacher of rhetoric. The way to become a lawgiver in ancient Greece was not only through being an Iatromantis; the best way was to be able to speak persuasively, and that is what Protagoras claimed to be able to teach. The fact is that Protagoras attracted hordes of young people, while we hear nothing similar in connection with Parmenides.Not only did Plato not &quot;kill&quot; Parmenides, if anything he RESCUED Parmenides from oblivion. Nowhere in his early dialogues did Plato pay the slightest bit of attention to Parmenides. Presumably, he ignored Parmenides because everyone else was ignoring him, too. In his middle dialogues, when he was supposedly steeped in Parmenidean thought, he mentioned him only twice (Symposium 178b and 195c). Neither mention contains any reference to Parmenides' metaphysics nor his cosmology; each is a reference to a genealogy of the gods. Even worse, in the Euthydemus, which is a dialogue written during the transition from the early to the middle periods, Plato seems to have thought of Parmenides as nothing but a sophist. (See 286c, particularly the phrase &quot;and others before them.&quot;) It wasn't until the late period that Plato suddenly began taking notice of Parmenides and speaking of him in glowing terms. Clearly, Plato had changed his mind about Parmenides, and it is because of that change of mind that we now know as much about Parmenides as we do.",book
1881,"After so many positive reviews I was excited to get and read this book. I have to say I'm disappointed. Firstly, it feels like the tone and approach Kingsley uses is geared towards children or teenagers; it's strange. Frankly, I don't like his use of the English language, I find it stilted. I kept thinking--get to the point, man.He's trying to do a couple of things at once, so far as I could see: create a kind of suspense story with the discovery of some statues with inscriptions on it and also to lay out what Parmenides was &lt;really> saying. I wasn't interested in the first aim--and I could barely follow his ""conclusions."" As far as the second, well... it doesn't sound all that different than what one can glean from the Upanishads or the Tao Te Ching or Chuang Tzu. But Kingsley posits it as the ""missing key"" in a sense.It is missing a glossary; and with a totally jumbled up ""references"" section it's very hard to know where he got his information. I appreciate his effort but I think he took himself a little too seriously.",book
1882,"But i can't give it more than 3 stars. Why? first, as the reviewer below states, Peter Kingsley throws out an awful lot of assumptions without any backup. No guided footnotes, no back story, just a jumble at the back of the book for people to sift through. Combined with his sensationalist style a-la The Davinci Code (not sure which came first), it's awful and insulting. Perhaps because of this style, he ends up wasting our time as he thinks things through for himself in parts without just giving us the information to think through ourselves - as if we're incapable of doing so...i really wonder how he can be a university professor since he talks to us like we're in high school. He does this while also telling us how great it is that the ancient Greeks did no such thing - they wrote simply but with deep meaning, and let the reader figure it out (i guess he's not as clever as they were? or does he think we aren't?) Oh, right -- throughout the book he explains that scholars are stupid and only he and a few others really understand how to explain what's going on! Yes, that's why!But even with all that, i was getting into this book in spite of myself, as he brought out a lot of interesting facts about the Phocaeans and Parmeneides. But when he literally pulled this one out of his a**--he said that some scholars actually believe the harmony of the spheres heard by Pythagoras was the sound of a snake hiss--i had to just laugh. Now, it's true that a large portion of people don't actually hear overtones, but there are many of us who do - and you don't mistake the sound for a hissing snake. Furthermore, to say such a thing totally dismisses all of Pythagoras's teachings about harmony and the overtone series, which wouldn't exist if all that were the case. But saying they sounded like ""pipes"" as Parmeneides and Pythagoras in fact did would be a better bet. I guess Peter likes to take what those dumb scholars said if they fit his own agenda. Indeed, Peter Kingsley apparently dismisses the actual word for pipes USED by the ancients, to bring hissing snakes into his theories. To twist something so simple around like that just made me lose respect for him. Sorry Peter. I wanted to like you because it's obvious you're a great student of this stuff, but you owe us a little more than that.In the end, what we learn that is so important is actually nothing new - that the great philosophers, mathematicians, etc. in ancient Greece were mystics, and that Plato shut the door on that. Well, that has been an acknowleged fact for a long long time. The sad thing is, that this book has some interesting information about the mysticism practiced. But it's couched in paragraphs and paragraphs of an angry tone about how there's a conspiracy (yes he uses that word) to keep people from knowing it. Too bad - but i guess it's because, if you take all the unnecessary stuff out, it would've been a much thinner book.",book
1883,"Kingsley's main point, if he has one, seems to be that logical reasoning is an inadequate instrument for grasping the metaphysical ambiguities of the world.His book applies that thesis with admirable consistency: it meanders all over the place, presents rumor and legend as fact, vastly over-states the importance of Parmenides for Platonic and later philosophy, and suggests that a conspiracy of scholars has kept all this information secret for millennia.Not that his ideas are completely without merit: Logic and language do have their limitations in describing reality. Parmenides was a significant pre-Socratic philosopher, even if not to the extent that Kingsley claims. And despite their avowed devotion to free inquiry, scholars are often hostile or indifferent to unconventional ideas.However, it seems to me that Kingsley has taken about two pages' worth of content and padded it out into a book. The writing is entertaining but the content is light and fluffy (which might be Kingsley's intention, if he meant to write a light popular book).""In the Dark Places of Wisdom"" is like ""The Da Vinci Code"" applied to pre-Socratic philosophers. All that's missing is the albino.",book

1887,"This is a great book regardless of how outlandish some of the stories it contains are. The author's greatest strength is not in forming unique opinions about the subject but rather in bringing together a vast number of sources to show an America completely different than what we've been lead to believe.The book just isn't about lost cities but also generally weird stuff throughout Central and North America. There is evidence of Asian contact with Central American cultures, pterodactyls in Arizona, Vikings in Oklahoma, Irish monks running all over the place, and those are the more believable stories. Atlantis or a gold city always seems to be around the corner, Jesus may have visited the New World, a master race is controlling the world from underground, the Egyptians had a colony in the Grand Canyon, and of course the government is covering all this up.The book does have its problems. The editing is horrible. The narrative that strings the author's travels together is wooden and painful to read. Each chapter stands by itself, but this means that some background material is repeated, often word for word. Overall these are minor issues.The book doesn't provide any answers but it does make a choice perfectly clear. You can either accept the traditional view that people wandered across a land bridge in Siberia to colonize the Americas and stayed relatively isolated and unadvanced until Europeans showed up in 1492 and wiped them out. Or you can read this book and see if there is evidence out there that suggests otherwise.",book
1888,"David H. Childress's Lost City series has been one of the most interesting collection of books I have read in a long time, however, I really don't know how accurate many of his theories are. Even many minor statements he makes, such as &quot;Native Americans can not grow facial hair&quot; are fallacies, I know an abundance of Native Americans, and they're facial hair rivals that of Che and Fidel. So when a guy gets facts as simple as these garbled, how much credibility can he possibly have when he starts rambling on about &quot;Smithsoniangate&quot;, and &quot;living dinosaurs&quot;.I find these possibilites as intriuguing as the next guy, but exactly where is his proof. He cites some archival information from an Arizona newspaper as proof that in the Grand Canyon in the early 1900's researchers found a cave full of Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Egyptian artifacts, and the Smithsonian museum came in and barricaded the area to this day(sort of like Raiders of the Lost Ark). And he uses oral history as proof that there are living Pteradactyls in the forests of Arizona. Perhaps Childress is correct in these assertions, and the US gov't is suppressing evidence of his relatively outlandish claims, then again, perhaps he's just trying to exploit the gullibility of the American public. But judging from his appearances on various talk shows, my guess is that he honestly believes that the gov't is suppressing information on the esoteric subjects he discusses in his books, of course this doesn't neccessarily mean that he's correct in these claims. I suppose that Childress's writings are extremely interesting, whether they are complete fabrications or are truisms. Reading this book certainly won't make you a better person, but it will force you to question what the author is claiming(that the US gov't is involved in clandestine activities of a paranormal nature, and that there are living prehistoric creatures), and will almost definitely force you to ponder what the US gov't plans to accomplish by suppressing ancient history(from my perspective they recieve no incentive by suppressing info that would link the Egyptians with North America). If you have a relatively large amount of time on your hands, I would definitely recommend this book, it makes you question the &quot;accepted&quot; history of the North American continent, but it also frustrates the reader with the lack of viable evidence to support his outrageous suggestions.",book
1889,"Much of this book is pleasant escape reading, and some of the things discussed are intriguing, such as tunnel systems associated with some ruins. The book was spoiled for me, however, when I came to chapters dealing with things I knew of firsthand. One major Northwest petroglyph site is placed in the wrong state. There are just enough wrongo facts to make me wonder how many others masquerade as reality in the text. I will reread the book in the future and enjoy the mysteries of past cultures south of the border, while keeping a salt block handy for the rest of it. His books certainly hold true to the basic instructions for finding lost cities - ask the locals. Few lost cities are truly lost to those who live in the area. They're just forgotten. Enjoy this as a tale told by a traveler, and a collection of some of the more interesting legends of American mystery archaeology. I don't really think there are Egyptian treasures in the Grand Canyon, but I would be delighted if they were real. The same holds true for the treasure-laden tunnels of Death Valley...",book
1890,"The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the &quot;Lost Cities&quot; series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself &quot;a rogue archeologist&quot;: someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition.",book
1891,"This book is very interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed reading it.Rather than a book that explains what places you can visit, how to get there and what to see when you go- this is more of a journal of the authors travels. In here he tells you what he sees, what he thinks and the things he learns.The author covers a wide range of thoughts from pteradactyles still living to Asians visiting Mexico to Romans in Arizona.I rated this a four instead of a five for two reasons. At times the writing seems stiff and it makes it hard to wade through some sections of this book. Also, the proofreading leads a lot to be desired. Words are left out, typos and spelling errors are plenty. Enough to be a distraction at times.Otherwise, it's an interesting book and well worth reading.Enjoy.",book
1892,"This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior &quot;giant&quot; races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book.",book
1893,"I thought I was a student of the esoteric but David Hatcher Childress makes me realize I am still only an alcolyte. History is a mystery and you can believe it because I told you so, just like your highschool history professor. This book will take you on the grand tour of North America and reveal some of the mystery that historians attempt to hide from us in their ivory towers. If you want to expand your mind without taking a lot of mind altering drugs try reading Mr. Chilress' Lost City books. He must have spent a lot of time in the underground book stores prior to his travels. That might be why he decided to hit the road in the first place, to find out for himself. Could America once have been a land of giants, or do pterydactyls still carry off unsuspecting travelers, or are there hidden books with knowledge from the ancients? Maybe, and maybe after reading this book, you will want to take a road trip and find out for yourself.Speak, Hear, and Believe",book
1894,"There are two ways to read Childress. If you want to live in a button-down, straight laced world of academic archeologists, then every time Childress asks a question, just answer (to yourself) No! Then go about with your boring life.But if you want to live a little wild, to peel back the layers & pierce the veil, then answer (again, to yourself) Yes! to every one of his questions. Should you do that, you will have a gay old time figuring out how the world all fits together!Honestly, DHC's speculations are full of BS, but it sure is fun suspending your disbelief & reading these books. Someone mentioned that DHC really seems like a great guy, and you get that sense reading this book. Sounds like he would be a really cool guy to travel & chat with. His travel writing is straighforward, but exciting.Unfortunately, the book is full of typos & poorly done photographs. After reading 5+ of the Lost Cities series, I don't even notice anymore, but it will bug some beginners.",book
1895,"I enjoy Childress' books mainly because he comes across as very honest, although he engages in too much speculation to be taken at face value. Overall I find his books a very engaging read, and the speculative aspect, though often unscientific, is very entertaining. Moreover, the amazing amount of study and travel he has done brings a certain amount of credibility to his work.",book
1896,"This was a very thought provoking book. The author himself has, been too many of the places described in the book, which adds a sincere element of realism to the story. This book is a ""must read"" if you are interested in ancient ruins and pyramids, but it is one book you will need to exercise a little personal judgment. The author is lacking in credibility and doesn't spend a great deal of time on details. This book could have easily been cut up into four separate books and the author could have spent a little more time researching the various regions discussed.I also found it very frustrating that the author didn't appear to make a better effort to explore some of the more mysterious areas talked about in the book. Portions of the Grand Canyon are supposedly restricted and contain mysterious magnetic fields that cause compasses to be offset. I am surprised that there hasn't been more attempts to access this area and that the government has not allowed research in this area. When researching the underwater ruins in the Great Lake, the author couldn't hold his breath very long so he had to surface. Given the importance of this research, another dive might have been nice to read about.I was convinced after reading this book that there have been many attempts over the years to discredit and hide evidence that is contradictory to the theory of Creation and Evolution. The author noted some 900 tablets that were supposedly discovered in a Mexican temple, but cannot be found.The pyramids in the U.S. are interesting as well, but I have since learned that the majority of the pyramids in the U.S. were made by ancient Indian cultures. The credit for these pyramids has been explored (although the author fails to mention this,) but it appears to be prejudice that has not allowed the Indians to receive the credit for their structures. It appears that the ancient Indians were much more advanced than the Indians that have existed in the last 300 years, which is also shown in their art prior to the discovery of maze. Like our own culture, the Indians suffered from over abundance, which led to the breakdown of their interdependent family units and their art. The evidence for this can be seen in the tooth decay, which occurred almost simultaneously with the loss of detailed artifacts buried in the pyramids.I also have to mention that the literary quality of this book is weak. The author could have spent a little more time editing. There were plenty of missing words and typos, which didn't help the credibility of the book. Otherwise, this book is well worth reading and is a good break from the more serious books out there. There is plenty of drama and lots of loose theories. If Indiana Jones were to write a book, it would probably read a lot like this book...Enjoy.",book
1897,"Regrettably I did not review this book thoroughly before buying it. If you believe flying dinosuars still exist in Texas, Jews settled thousands of years ago in Florida and Van Daniken is a scientist then this book ought to be right down your alley. The book is written with a rambling style similar to the apparently mindless wandering of the author. He speculates about things that are far beyond the borders of reason into worlds as mystical as the religions of those he portrays.Spinkled among this piffle is a series of semi-sound observations...just enough to lead you to think the author has some expertise on the subject. Far from it. Each sites origin is distorted beyond any recognition by the most casual but serious archeologist. Hoax articles in papers are given equal consideration to any evidence, no matter that much of that evidence is sparse. The most perplexing mysteries are left with some speculative conjecture and absolutely no support for it. A tale told by an idiot and full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.It is all bunkum and a waste of my money.",book
1898,"The Lost Cities series by David Hatcher Childress has proven for me to be probably the most entertaining, thoroughly informative, and thought provoking series of books I have ever read and have also served as an invaluable road map for my own travels around the world in search of ancient mysteries. I have traveled, so far, to several locations in Egypt, Malta, Europe, Asia, Central and South America and each time I have used his books to plan my route and have taken whichever one I needed for the journey as a guide. I bought the whole series long ago and they are generally beat to hell if not falling apart at this point and I wouldn't have them any other way. Reading this series made me make up my mind that I could never be satisfied being a spectator of the debate, but the only way to truly know these mysteries was to be a participant and see them for myself. At the very least this series should inspire you to get out there, live your life as a traveler and not a tourist and go see these places for yourself. Save the money, do it cheap, whatever you have to do, but don't let the opportunity to actually go there pass you by in this life.Equal parts detective story, travel guide, diary, history book, and compendium of esoteric knowledge; what makes these books so unique, among other things, is that Childress takes the reader with him through every step of the journey -cold beers, missed trains, broken legs, chance encounters, stolen wallets, one night stands in far away places, wishing you could stay but knowing you can't. All the while on the trail of an ever growing mystery with every answer leaving only more questions spurring you on to the next stop wondering what will happen next. One thing I always respected about Childress in these books, which some may not get the point, is that while at times he does present off-beat esoteric ideas about lost civilizations, it is done so not to promote any particular idea, but rather to give a greater context of the history of the literature of the last few hundred years concerning lost civilizations in the hope that something worthwhile might be gleaned from even the most outlandish or dated of source. To him it is a journey and to his credit does little to leave any stone unturned. But also unique to Childress compared with other writers of the genre is that other than the obvious general idea that there is much more to the story of history than we know, he rarely takes a definitive stance on any pet theory, but rather presents the information with more of a sense of wonder and openness and is really not trying to sell the reader on anything either way other than the necessity to keep an open mind. All just interesting to know and he leaves the reader to think of it what they will which is refreshing.All and all very interesting and entertaining and I highly recommend getting the whole series. The Lost Cities series are true classics of the genre and should be a front and center addition to any alternative researchers library and as a whole are an unparalleled source of of information about many megalithic sites and discoveries you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else. Hopefully they will inspire you as they did me.",book

1902,"If a pagan and primitive band of Asians wandered over 3,000 miles atop 2 mile thick icesheets (and brought enough food for the journey), settled all of the Americas, and then remained primitive and pagan until Conquistadors and Missionaries of the Church of the Inquisition arrived to set them straight, they hardly could have built the enigmatic (and often mathematically sophisticated) monuments that David Childress has encountered throughout the Americas. For one that Childress missed -- and for an important link to ancient navigational cultures -- see Atlantis in America.",book
1903,"I was looking forward to an entertaining account of eccentric archaeological theories, but was unprepared for this disorganized 586-page ramble through North America, from Costa Rica to Canada. The author visits numerous prehistoric sites that (to him, anyway) challenge the current academic orthodoxy. The book is more ego trip than road trip, however, as the author writes in pointless mind-numbing detail of how he travels, where he stays, what he eats, and long verbatim conversations he has with chance acquaintances over beers. In the hands of a better writer this might be interesting, but although Childress is an intrepid traveler, he is only a poor-to-middling writer. The book screams for a stern editor to trim the self-indulgent detail down to something readable, and to improve some of his awkward writing. I must confess that I couldn't read the whole thing: the author bored me unmercifully in his slow progress through Guatemala, so I thumbed forward to the chapters on the US.Childress styles himself a ""maverick archaeologist"" (p.9), but it is not clear from this book that he has any right, by either education or work experience, to the title archaeologist. He has clearly read much on alternative prehistories which claim extensive pre-Columbian contacts between North America and outside cultures, both real (Egyptian, Roman, Chinese) and imagined (Atlantis and Lemuria). He has also read some of the orthodox counter-arguments (p.439), such as Stephen Williams' excellentFantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory, but he dismisses them as the work of fuddy-duddy academics. To Childress, academic archaeology is essentially a conspiracy to suppress new ideas. Had he spent any time among academics, however, Childress might have learned that the only way for an academic to make a name for himself is exactly to have new ideas and challenge the status quo.Along the way, Childress indiscriminately embraces every tall tale (pterodactyls in present-day Texas and Arizona, Mothman in West Virginia), odd phenomenon (Bermuda Triangle and tourist ""mystery spots"") and newspaper hoax (19th century reporters were prone to make up fantastic stories on slow news days; Mark Twain first made his name writing such tongue-in-cheek lies). The book might have been useful as a starting-point for Fortean tourism, but it does not even include an index, so I can only give it two stars.",book
1904,"I received this book as a birthday present last month from a friend who has read a number of Childress's books. As we share an interest in anthropology and have visited some of the sites in New Mexico mentioned in this book, she thought I would enjoy it. And I did! This book is part travelogue, part archaeology text, and part collection of legends, folktales, and any odd theories he comes across. The mix makes for interesting reading. Childress is intelligent and well-informed but quirky as well. His observations on people he meets and life in the places he visits are at times insightful, funny, and strange.The only warning I'd give is that the books published by Adventures Unlimited tend to be poorly edited so don't be surprised to find some spelling and grammar errors present. Still, these errors didn't detract from my enjoyment of ""Lost Cities of North and Central America.""This isn't a serious academic text, but it's quite informative, an excellent read, and lots of fun!",book
1905,"Of course, the reason others won't tell you those stories may be because the stories are patently false. I was looking for a book that would be a good read after ""Collapse"" -- something that would tell me about fallen civilizations. This isn't that book -- at least not from a rigorous, scientific approach. The author, for example, asserts that pterodactyls live in today's Arizona.The author believes that traditional academics are dismissing the truth because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions. The only reason I didn't rate this book lower is that it is clearly a great source for others who feel the same way. The rest of us, however, need to look elsewhere for scientifically grounded speculation into North American prehistory.",book
1906,"I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk.",book
1907,"I didn't know what to expect from adventurer Childress. Some of his books range from merely odd to the bizarre. Lost Cities, however, was a compendium of lost worlds in North America. He attempts to novelize his book a bit through relating is travels, generally I skimmed these parts. He's not really out there doing any real research, in fact he's mostly recounting or quoting what others have written elsewhere and puts it together for one book. Many of his books are like this, so if you want books that distill whole topics into one volume, Childress is your man. And there's a lot of interesting material here from lost cities in the Grand Canyon to mysterious ""dinosaur"" birds.Perhaps the weakness of the book is that he doesn't examine these finds very deeply, but I don't think he intends to verify or disapprove, but to collect and report. And sometimes he will show some lack of research. For example, once in awhile I'd catch some ridcoulous comment, like p. 355 where he implies the Church plunged Europe into the Dark Ages. Maybe it wasn't meant that way, in any case, many historians are now discarding the idea of ""Dark Ages."" After all, the renaissance didn't pop out of no where. SeeThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success.Also, his theology is a bit weak, claiming Jesus surviving the crucifixion is a ""credible"" (p. 247) possibility. Reading a bit too many conspiracy books I see? Let's see, he was tortured and nailed to a cross and stabbed, and it's ""credible"" that he survived? Childress claims a dead person wouldn't bleed if stabbed. Actually, John 19:34's ""sudden flow of blood and water"" is a clear evidence that Jesus was dead. Modern medicine knows this as the pericardial and pleural effusions surrounding the heart and lungs. This fluid collects as the result of hypovolemic shock and was released when the spear pierced the heart and/or lungs. Who in the ancient world would survive a stab in the heart and lungs? SeeThe Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesusfor more.But I didn't read this for theology. I'm still hoping for the day that North American archaeology is taken more seriously. If you want to help, subscribe toAmerican Archaeology(which includes an Archaeology Conservancy membership).In any case, I've been enjoying the Lost Cities series. While many of these sites would be interesting to visit, these books allow armchair exploring. They allow scholars to study forbidden topics. If nothing else, through this series, Childress has created an encyclopedia set of lost cites, vanished peoples and forgotton history.",book

1909,"Here is the thing - I am giving this book a high score (4) since it contains unique and fun content related to network infrastructure attacks and defenses, which I have not seen anywhere else. In my view, the good stuff justifies such score, although I suspect that some other reviewers will sledgehammer the book for having too much of routine material covered in other previous books, including the venerable Hacking Exposed.While I had a general idea of how providers mitigate DDoS attacks, I did not know the specifics of unicast reverse-path forwarding method, described in the book. Similarly, I picked up a lot of material of setting up sinkholes for dropping traffic (and, more specifically, how they are better than ACLs in many cases).From other topics, I liked their coverage on the evolution of DMZ from simple designs of years past to current security zone design.The book also presents a lot of up-to-date material, such as the coverage of security information management (SIM), vulnerability management and recent security standards, such as CVSS. It doesn't go into details in some places where I'd wanted it to, but still is interesting to read.On the other hand, some chapters are disappointing and seem to be in the book for it to appear ""comprehensive"". Forensics chapter is one of those (it is also mistakenly called ""Exploiting Forensics"", while no exploitation is taking place)I recommend the book for most people, from beginners to advanced, since the former will enjoy the breadth of coverage while the latter will likely benefit from the network infrastructure protection (and devastation, of course!) tips. In addition, defense checklists in the end of each chapter are useful for those who do not have time to go and study the material in-depth. The book is slightly biased towards the defense side, with good coverage of the attacking side as well.Dr Anton Chuvakin, GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a recognized security expert and book author. In his current role as a Security Strategist with netForensics, a security information management company, he is involved with defining future features and conducting security research. A frequent conference speaker, he also represents the company at various security meetings and standard organizations. He is an author of a book ""Security Warrior"" and a contributor to ""Know Your Enemy II"", ""Information Security Management Handbook"" and the upcoming ""Hacker's Challenge 3"". Anton also published numerous papers on a broad range of security subjects. In his spare time he maintains his security portal at info-secure.org and a blog at O'Reilly""",book
1910,"Regardless of how many steps you take to secure your organizational computing environment, there's always some new exploit waiting to nail you.

I worked with Brett Watson at a prior place of employment, and I can attest to the fact that he really knows his trade. In the first part of this book, they go into networking and security probably deeper than any other book I've had the opportunity to review. To get the most out of the material, it helps to be firmly grounded in networking technology. If you're not a network administrator or if you're just starting out, you'll probably struggle to keep up. Parts 2 and 3 are also valuable sections. Part 2 continues the in-depth analysis of how best to protect your network from attack, along with software recommendations to implement your security plans. And if you aren't already using a formal methodology to continuously review your network security, Part 3 will help you set up the necessary framework to implement a solid security review. Part 4 probably is the weakest part of the book, in that most of the material is available from multiple other sources, and doesn't necessarily fit into the ""extreme exploits"" flavor of the rest of the book. It's good information, to be sure... Just not all that unique or special if you've read more than one other security book.One feature at the end of each chapter stood out and works well... It's a ""Checklist for Developing Defenses"" along with a recommended reading list. Using the checklist allows you to make sure you understood what each chapter was getting at, as well as giving you a roadmap for implementing security in the particular area that was just discussed. And if a particular chapter was really applicable to your organization, the follow-up reading can help you get even deeper into the material. Good practical technique for helping the reader move from theory to application...If you have the basics of network security down, it's time to pick up a copy of this book. While you may have to work at understanding the material, it will pay off in a system network that is much more secure than most...",book
1911,"I read Extreme Exploits because the content looked intriguing and I am familiar with applications written by lead author Victor Oppleman. The back cover states the book is ""packed with never-before-published advanced security techniques,"" but I disagree with that assessment. While I found all of the content helpful, between 1/3 and 1/2 of it is probably available in older books -- including several by publisher McGraw-Hill/Osborne. Nevertheless, I find the strength of the network infrastructure security sections powerful enough to recommend Extreme Exploits.I found Extreme Exploit's most innovative material in chapter 1 (Internet Infrastructure), 2 (ISP Security Practices), 4 (Reliable Connectivity), 8 (Email Gateways, Filtering, and Redundancy), 10 (Sinkholes and Backscatter, and 14 (Performing the Assessment, Part 1). These chapters introduced projects like RADB, IRRd, INOC-DBA (a VoIP ""hotline"" for ISPs), the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (an anti-spam system), and Hashcash (to consume CPU cycles and frustrate spammers). Subjects like questions to ask ISPs, ways to multi-home, and using anycast to improve redundancy were also welcome. A comment that spammers are using people who register with porn sites to pass CAPTCHA tests really surprised me! Ch 10's coverage of ISP sinkholes was clear, and I learned about triggered blackhole routing. Advice on checking publicly announced routes was cool, especially the reference to the author's Pwhois system.Although the vulnerability and patch management information in ch 12 was fairly routine, I also liked the author's mention of recent industry projects like the NIAC vulnerability lifecycle and Common Vulnerability and Scoring System.Other chapters mainly covered topics found in other books, like Hacking Exposed, Gray Hat Hacking, or Hardening Network Security (all Osborne titles). Most of the book contains sound advice, but I must disagree with several assertions made in ch 7 (Intrusion Detection and Prevention). These include the ""rejection"" of the value of passive detection (p 116), the ""logical transition"" where detection and prevention converges into firewalls (p 116), the idea that intrusion prevention systems are ""less prone to insertion and evasion attacks"" (p 120), and ""signature-based IDS normally do not have an understanding of the underlying protocol that they are examining and simply perform byte-by-byte pattern matching"" (p 121).Almost all of the vulnerability assessment material could have been cut, aside from the BGP query and network infrastructure advice in ch 14. The misnamed ""exploiting digital forensics"" chapter (16) tempts the reader into thinking it will cover anti-forensics, but really it's an overview of network-, host-, and memory forensics in 26 pages. An excerpt from p 332 summarizes the problem with the chapter: ""At this point, you might be asking, what do I do with the data?"" Still, ch 16 deserves an honorable mention for describing multiple tools with which I was not familiar or had only passing familiarity. These included Foremost by Jesse Kornblum and Kris Kendall, Disktype, and Memdump.In terms of structure, I liked the fact that every chapter concluded with a ""checklist for developing defenses"" summarizing important points in an actionable format. The writing is always clear, and the diagrams are excellent. Many of the network infrastructure suggestions are supported by command-line syntax and examples, consistent with Osborne's Hacking Exposed style.Overall, I think most everyone will learn something by reading Extreme Exploits. Those with a decent amount of experience or who have read books already mentioned might find some of the book repetitive. Despite this, I learned a lot about network infrastructure and I look forward to reading Victor's upcoming book on ""Carrier Class Network Security.""",book
1912,"The book has two major sections: (a) configuration and maintenance practices, and (b) techniques for vulnerability assessment. The breadth of coverage of many modern techniques and terminology is very good; they go in-depth on a few topics here and there.The basic assumption of section (a) is that you're trying to defend against unknown/unfixable threats. This is basically the current (2001-2005-) school of thought on security and leads to default-deny policies. This book has lots of good information on how to implement default-deny. The book convinced me that it's much more difficult than a default-deny firewall rule.The book has many contributing authors; this probably contributes to its strength.Many books are focused on ISPs, or on enterprises (read: ""windows clients and servers with a firewall""), or on software developers, or VoIP carriers. This book has some good material for all of those types.It's written from a Unix perspective. It does have some coverage of analyzing threats to Windows-based systems, but you'll get the most value from the book as an analyst/administrator if you use some sort of Unix. They have a BSD bias.The authors also have an bias towards open-source software.But it's not perfectly integrated, and the organization isn't ideal everywhere. For example, there are two sections of the book that discuss buffer overflows, apparently contributed by two different authors.The index is only minimal; it only covers one of the sections on stack overflows. Bad indexes are a common problem in technical books from some publishers.",book
1913,"First I must admit that I know and have worked with several of the authors of this book. I was given an autographed copy of the book late last year, however seeing as the book was published in 2005 I didn't think there would be much along the lines of useable information seeing as many of the security threats and vulnerabilities have evolved quite a bit since then. However, as I started reading the book I quickly realized much of the information was still relevant today as it was several years ago. The chapters on ISP Security Practices and Securing the Domain Name System had very good coverage of many of the techniques used throughout Service Provider networks to secure their network and DNS infrastructure.I particularly enjoyed reading the sections on using egress packet filters to restrict data leaks from within an organization - a particular problem today with the prevalance of Internet Worms and other Malware which often attempt to communicate back to their centralized Command & Control (C&C;) hosts. The chapter on 'Sinkholes and Backscatter' has very good coverage on a wide variety of topics such as using Darknets and Honeynets to monitor malicious traffic and other nasties emanating throughout your network, as well as using techniques such as Triggered Blackhole Routing to propagate filters quickly and dynamically to drop DDoS and other malevolent traffic.I would have to disagree with Dr. Anton Chuvakin that the chapters on Digital Forensics were disappointing. Personally, I learned quite a bit from these chapters and came away from reading them with a whole arsenal of new tools to use with which I can perform my own digital forensics on compromised systems. The coverage of Foremost, memdump, and some of the advanced digital forensic tools was top notch.All in all, I would say this is still a good book for anyone involved in Network Security. Much of the information covered is still relevant in today's networks. If the authors attempt to release a second edition I would suggest coverage of adapting Triggered Blackhole techniques to be used in more modern DDoS Mitigation scenarios. Additionally, discussion of new techniques used for Malware C&C; and coverage of Fast-flux and Double-flux techniques used by the attackers to create more robust and reliable networks would be welcomed.",book

The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring.

1916,"Jensen has expanded Ch. 12 of his excellent Brain-based Learning into this valuable contribution to educators in summarising and highlighting the importance of movement and activities for learning. The distinction between explicit learning (test-oriented lecture, textbooks, research, video, and discussion) and implicit learning (dance, theater, physical education, recess, aerobics, energizers, sports, and simple games) is useful. This book makes a strong case for implicit learning. Those who are familiar with Jensen's work can expect a good, up-to-date grounding in brain functioning and the scientific basis of various practices. Most readers will find the book an informative, readable resource. Numerous drawings and charts facilitate the understanding. &quot;65 all-time best activators&quot; have been selected. In trying to give an overall coverage, some areas may inevitably be given short shrift. For example, practitioners of Brain Gym are leading in introducing movement in education with great results based on research.

1918,"Representing Reality theorizes documentary in all-round perspectives. Among others, I think this book is important especially in that it raises the question of reality per se. Documentary has always been marginal not only in discourse but also in cinema industry, under the poor understanding of reality. I think Nichols's notion of &quot;reflexivity&quot; is a key concept itself in understanding documentary, which also provides a good alternative reading regarding what is documentary or not. I think this book will give you a great deal of food for thought, when you have ever contemplated what is real and when we become to question about what we are seeing, not only in films but also in real life.",book

1932,"BOOK REVIEWJunk Science Judo. Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, Cato Institute, Washington, DC, USA, 2001, ix-xii + 218 pp.A superb manual for understanding health claims and detecting fraud, ""Junk Science Judo"" is written in a punchy, easy-to-read style that allows the mathematically challenged, like myself, to interpret the usual bell-curve statistics that are used for environmental health threats and diet threats. One may also use this approach to judge the benefits of prescription drugs or alternative treatments. He shows how to look for p values of 0.05 or less, and he shows how to use the 95% confidence intervals (CI) to see whether the low or high limit crosses the reference value of 1.00. If it does, Milloy suggests disregarding any result that is claimed.In epidemiological or ecologic studies, Milloy suggests discarding those results in which the relative risk (RR) is between 0.5 and 2.00, whichever applies. Milloy goes far beyond the usual cautions that an association is not necessarily a cause. He is contemptuous of, but not totally dismissive of epidemiology. For Milloy, the descending pecking order of research on health hazards is: clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and ecologic studies. He describes publication bias, confounding, and ""tainted experts"". He reminds us that mice are not little people, and that there is a safe dose of everything.Milloy encourages intelligent contact with the sources of health advice to support or refute the recommendations, and he recommends a number of sources of supposedly reliable health information. His criticism of medical journals, which includes the defects of peer-review, is the most detailed I have seen in print, and very well-taken, in my opinion. He skewers broadcast media on their emphasis on ratings rather than accuracy or balance. He deplores the motivation of many activists. Many specific examples are given, from Alar to radiation.This book is extremely valuable for helping anyone who is not a medical or epidemiological specialist to judge the value of health or health-threat claims.Now the bad news. Milloy does not question the use 1-tailed statistics, or the failure of many relationships to follow a bell-curve (Kauffman, 2001). Milloy failed to warn of the common deception of reporting an effect of something on a certain health condition without the inclusion of total death rates. Milloy's fine example of prostate cancer ""non-prevention"" by eating foods high in selenium (p164) may mislead people into ignoring the benefits of selenium supplementation, which has been shown in a clinical trial to lower the RR of all cancers to 0.83 (95% CI 0.47-0.85), and is most effective against lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers (Clark et al., 1996). Milloy downplays the dangers of trans fats (Oomen et al., 2001), but his own example shows that the highest two quintiles of consumption are not healthful (p165). Milloy made the mistake of writing that the absence of a biological explanation for the claimed effects of electric and magnetic fields means that they have no effects (p76); readers of JSE know that such judgments based on lack of knowledge are faulty. ....Joel M.

1933,"Hardly a day can pass without hearing about some new threat to our health from something in our food or in the air that we breathe. In his lively style, Steven J. Milloy has written a &quot;self-defense guide&quot; to help the average consumer know when to be alarmed or when to proceed with life as usual.Junk Science Judo is filled with examples of questionable conclusions drawn from data from a wide variety of sources. Milloy relates how zealous lawyers can draw false or misleading inferences from scientific data in order to extract large rewards from lawsuits against defendants with deep pockets, often with collaboration from those in the &quot;scientific&quot; community who stand to profit from their &quot;research&quot; (what better way to justify large government grants to continue research into some promising area?). Most telling are the cases of the lawsuits involving breast implants and Agent Orange, where a total absence of evidence was ignored by courts and juries eager to punish unpopular defendants and to reward those who were definitely disadvantaged (but probably not as a result of either the implants or Agent Orange).Despite a generally good job of writing a primer on how not to be taken in by faulty conclusions or misleading inferences of cause and effect, Chapter 11 of this book contains one significantly dubious conclusion of the author himself. In a discussion of the statistical technique of meta-analysis (a technique where the results of numerous small studies are combined to simulate one large study), Milloy repeatedly takes stabs at this respected technique. His criticisms appear to be based mainly on questions raised in an editorial in a medical journal where the editor cited poor data quality and publication bias (i.e., only research studies showing significant results tend to get published) as reasons for questioning conclusions from meta-analysis. Although the editor is correct, it does not follow that all meta-analysis is therefore useless. Given enough well-executed studies without bias in the findings, meta-analysis can be a very useful and enlightening tool.I highly recommend that all consumers of information either purchase this book or at least borrow it from someone, and read it thoroughly. I suspect that you will never again be able to read uncritically any account of some purported new crisis brought on by zealous lawyers, journalists or politicians. When some &quot;scientific&quot; conclusion appears to be counterintuitive, it is most likely incorrect. Subsequent research may, in fact, show that the conclusions were incorrect, but (since this is not exciting) the correction is likely not to be brought to the public's attention. Since it is impossible to prove a negative, the burden of proof should be on the scientific community to exercise caution in releasing insignificant findings to the press. Junk science may sell newspapers or gain an audience for the evening news, but it is devastating when it causes major disruptions in the lives of people who either aren't given the whole picture or who can't interpret the information when it is presented.The best defense against junk science is an informed public. Read this book and you will definitely become better informed!",book
1934,"Some parts of this book literally left my jaw hanging open. The endless examples of high-level fraud in government agencies and special interest groups are enough to make any logical thinker sick.Bear in mind that this book is probably not for the trained scientist. The author takes time to explain basic research concepts for the casual reader, and also interjects his own attitude to make the book more fun to read. However, for those readers who do want to check up on the author's science, the 17-page listing of 314 cited studies should leave no question that the author beckons the audience to follow his own advice by examining his research.If I had one complaint about this book, it would be that the author often relies too heavily on quoted material. I think the author is trying to show that he was not skewing the cited studies, as would the individuals he criticizes in the book. While effective in this regard, the practice sometimes results in a monotonous pattern. The author's comments on the quoted studies become predictable midway through the book as the reader learns to identify the glaring problems in cited research methods.In the end, this book was an excellent read for the choir to which it preaches. I would recommend it as an excellent resource for anybody who wants ammunition to fight junk science, or to back up political debate with embarrassing proof of the ineptitude on which many health/environmental policies are based. Anybody who cares about ridding public policy of special interest politics should read through this book once and keep it handy for later use as a reference tool.",book
1935,"I purchased this book after spending much time on Mr. Milloy's web site, www.junkscience.com, and found it to be an excellent primer on the way information is manipulated to serve various purposes.The book is well-written, and an easy read, with an eye toward the scientific novice. But the book focuses not so much on science, but on statistics, which are often used as a surrogate for science. Indeed, Mr. Milloy never claims to be a scientist; his biography notes that he has a degree in statistics, making him well-qualified to criticize the misuse of such numbers.I recently had the opportunity to use the information gleaned from ""Junk Science Judo."" A local group used a study as evidence that cranberry bogs present a cancer risk, i.e., the hypothesis of the study was that living near cranberry bogs exposed local residents to enough pesticides to cause cancer. While the authors did find a correlation between living near cranberry bogs and a particular kind of brain cancer, it was only a correlation.This was an ecologic epidemiological study (the worst kind according to Mr. Milloy). The authors never established that the study subjects were exposured to the pesticides used on cranberry bogs; blood or urine samples were never obtained, but a formula was used to estimate exposure levels.There were other problems; the sample size was too small (only a dozen individuals had brain cancer) to be of value; cancer rates were no higher for those individuals who had known exposures to pesticides (such as pest control or agricultural workers) than for the control group; pesticide use on the cranberry bogs could only be guessed at - the authors did not know what pesticides were used, when they were used or in what quantities.In short, the study raised more questions than answers. But when I critizied the study and the use of it, the only thing anyone could say was, ""Pesticides are toxic."" Well, duh. But as Mr. Milloy notes, the dose makes the poison.Ironically, most of the bad reviews of this book make an issue out of motivation, and appear to be criticizing Mr. Milloy personally, instead of the book and its contents.Scientists can be activists, and when they are they often hide behind their scientific training, claiming to be impartial even as they advocate a certain point of view (believe me, I've encountered them). And just because a corporation pays for a study does not mean that that study is any less relevant than one paid for by an environmental organization. I've gone so far as to research some of the examples Mr. Milloy uses (such as the Love Canal) and found them to be true.My point - and that of Mr. Milloy's book - is to look at the claims made with a critical eye; examine the science behind them. In ""Junk Science Judo,"" Mr. Milloy provides us with the information needed to determine if the claims made are true, exaggerated, or completely out of the ballpark. This book is not a collection of blind rants, but a close examination of how public health claims are made and justified (rightly or wrongly).Get the book, but keep an open mind, because there is no doubt that it will challenge some of your basic assumptions. If you're a natural skeptic, it will give you a foundation upon which to base your skepticism. If you're not a skeptic, it will open your eyes.",book
1936,Every day American readers are given scare stories about health issues in news accounts based on some statistics and little analysis. Many accounts are circulated by special interest groups or lawyers. Milloy's background in law and health lends to his ability to point out the fallacies of 'junk science' and tips on how the average reader can separate junk science from real science.,book
1937,"Steven Milloy is a journalist, and pundit whose principled stand on behalf of scientific logic benefits all of us. He stands side by side with Stephen Jay Gould and Michael Schermer in debunking the outrageous claims of pseudo science. Milloy attempts to provide a framework to evaluate the nonsensical claims made by individuals and organizations with agendas which are independent of the facts. It is this framework he calls ""junk science judo."" Actually what he provides us is the kind of suspicious phraseology and statistical trickery often employed by scammers. In most cases it would take a thorough review of the claimants' research techniques and statistical interpretation to spot the scam. We come away suspicious of almost any claim. All in all, though, Milloy is readable and he is right. Don't miss his column, ""Junk Science,"" on the Opinion page of FoxNews.com.Postscript: With the passage of time I've become aware of a blind spot in Milloy's vision. It doesn't appear in this book, but it does repeatedly in his columns and website. He denies global warming, which is reliably documented by science. Where junk science enters the debate is in the extent of human causality. To date there is no credible evidence for human causality; it is an issue pressed by political populists and our competitors in global trade. Global warming is good science; human causality is junk science. Science shows that if humans disappeared from the Earth, global warming would continue, and likely continue to accelerate. Milloy is so incensed by the assertion of human causality that he denies warming altogether. In his acceptance of the politicization of the debate, he plays into the hands of his adversaries. His willingness to distort facts in support of this cause unnecessarily introduces doubt about his objecivity in other issues.",book
1938,"And, those who have no valid counter arguments use ad hominem attacks.If your ""Statistics for Health Professionals"" class was as incomplete as mine, then, you need this book.

By learning and living these rules, you will at last be able to free yourself from those maddening health scares that bombard us daily. Milloy writes in a sassy, bold as brass style that entertains whilst it informs. Personally, I like that sort of thing. This book is an easy read, and if you really, really want to, you can find and read the original studies that are discussed. Then you will appreciate an author who can tackle complex subjects in a straightforward manner, and be funny in the bargain.""When the enemy comes welcome him, when he goes, send him on his way,"" is a tenet of the practice of the art of judo. Milloy will show you the enemy, and equip you with the means of speedily dispatching them to the junk pile where they belong. You will truly welcome the next scientific study you encounter.",book
1939,"If you're tired of being frightened and victimized by the never ending procession of doom-and-gloom prognostications, this book is for you. It lucidly explains how statistics and &quot;scientific&quot; studies are routinely manipulated by groups with their own agendas who are willingly assisted by the media who are all too happy to be given a shocking headline for public consumption. After reading this book, you will never react to alarmist news reports in the same way.",book
1940,"The book, ""Junk Science Judo"" by Steven Milloy prepares you to be able to identify the junk science that gives you a false sense of security, reduces your wealth and peace of mind, and may get you fired. The fundamental purpose of this book is to defend you, friends, relatives, and your business from junk science. The definition of junk science in the book is, ""Falty scientific data and analysis used to advance a special interest"" (Milloy 34). There is a ton of junk science in the world as Milloy points out, such as, deception about second hand smoke, chlorinated water, breast implants, over the counter drugs, organic food, and so on. There are overwhelming amounts of people that have a false sense of security about their health from absorbing junk science.Milloy describes the types of people responsible for junk science in his book. The people involved in junk science range from small time con artists to as big as people inside government agencies. Basically anyone could be a potential candidate for posting junk science, because it is so easy to do. One example of junk science is the claim that grapefruit juice is heart healthy. There is no solid evidence that supports that claim. The con artists posting junk science go out of their way to establish a cause and effect relationship with what they are trying to prove. These people are interested in their own succession, and should not be considered scientists at all.A really captivating point in the book is that news channels, such as CNN, often report pseudoscience. Reporters are not supposed to make up lies, but the information they broadcast is not always true. Milloy brings up a good point that the news does not like debunking there own news. This book teaches you to have doubts about even the most reliable sources. Often times, many studies that back up a claim are done on small sample sizes, which often makes them useless to the population as a whole. Frequently activists put their own desires before the facts, and will say anything to promote their claim. Junk science even gets through the judicial system, and pollutes the courts and juries. Millions upon millions of dollars have been lost due to junk science legislation.After reading ""Junk Science Judo"" what you think is true, may not be true to you anymore. You will see the doubt in many of the claims that you have come across in your life. Think about this question for instance, how could you personally tell if eating cereal gave you cancer? You can't. You have to take someone else's word for it, and they could either have reliable or unreliable data. The fact of the matter is that often times you hear of the unreliable data. You will even realize that politicians use pseudoscience to get elected. Although it is wrong in every way, pseudoscience often means an easy route to the top; that is if you don't get caught. After reading this book you will understand the importance of the scientific method, taking an idea from a theory to a scientific law, and how generations builds upon each other's claims.This book was easy to read in the sense that there was a lot to catch your attention, and never would you feel stuck on one topic or event. There are countless examples of junk science in this book. Each lesson teaches you more and more about how to defend yourself against junk science. The length of the book made it not discouraging to get through. It wasn't too long, or filled with any dull or useless information. Even if you are a person who is stubborn, Milloy's point that you ought to be, ""Better safe than sorry."" (Milloy 148) will probably end up saving your skin one day.The book ""Junk Science Judo"" shows you the key default assumptions in health risk assessments. Milloy teaches you to become aware that many researchers like to skip the testing stage, and get a conclusion with no proof. One fact is that, ""Theories, anecdotes, and assumptions aren't proof of anything"" (Milloy 225). I really enjoyed how much this book taught me, and prepared me for a world filled with pseudoscience. For instance when you hear big numbers, it often comes with a large amount of falsity. Statistics are not proof of anything, and many people like to use them because they lack the proof they need. As Milloy states, ""Statistics are the lingua franca of junk science."" (Milloy 212), which is the truth.If you are a person who is for animal rights, there are some facts that might be upsetting toward the end of the book or in Lesson 9 to be exact. Junk scientists often get societies attention using Bioassays, or animal experiments that are often times wrongly performed. Basically the idea in this part of the book is that rats differ from humans, and what is claimed to be harmful to them, cannot necessarily be claimed to harm people, but often is. The book goes over all of the epidemiologic basic studies, such as clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and ecologic studies. There are many charts and examples in the book to give you an idea of what goes on.By reading ""Junk Science Judo"" you will realize that much of the junk science you retain has been engraved in your mind throughout your life, and it will be a challenge to distinguish the pseudoscience from actual science. I agree with the author that by the end of the book you will be a black belt in junk science judo. I would highly recommend reading this book because of the life lessons it taught me.",book
1941,"I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require &quot;attitude.&quot; In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy &quot;The Vintage Mencken&quot; to read his evisceration of chiropractic.",book
1942,"Steven Milloy is the self proclaimed ""director"" of The Advancement for Sound Science Coalition also known as TASSC. This coalition is a think tank for corporate interests. The objective of the TASSC is to debunk modern scientific research that concludes corporate pollution has serious consequences on he environment.So Steven's objective is to discredit any scientific findings that come to the conclusion that corporate America's pollution has now and will continue to have global effects on the environment. So he criticizes the results of real scientists that are doing objective research and labels them as radical liberals. He calls their science ""junk science"" .The only slip in reasoning here is that the scientists that conclude big business pollution is destructive to the environment and our health weren't paid by billion dollar Industries to come to these conclusions.Steven Milloy and TASSC are funded gratuitously by corporate America to debunk global warming and any other scientific findings that run counter to corporate America's interests.Originally TASSC was funded by Philip Morris with the goal of debunking the scientific conlusion that second hand smoke is hazardous to your health. Would you believe that? If I was paid a million dollars by Phillip Morris to say second hand smoke is not dangerous to your health would you believe me? I really hope not. But that is just what Steven Milloy does. He gets paid enormously by corporate America to say that environmental scientists (who weren't paid off to come to specific conclusions) are the one's producing the junk science. His original funding came from Phillip Morris but TASSC is funded by the following corporations: 3M, Amoco, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Motors, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lorillard Tobacco, Louisiana Chemical Association, National Pest Control Association, Occidental Petroleum, Philip Morris Companies, Procter & Gamble, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and W.R. Grace, the asbestos and pesticide manufacturers.If you think I'm making this all up do a Google search on ""Steven J. Milloy Spin doctoring"" or ""Steven J. Milloy Phillip Morris"" and see all of the legitimate resources that expose his true ulterior motives. That is, if you actually do care about the truth more than you care about not being labeled as a liberal radical.The name calling is how these billion dollar corporations enforce compliance by labeling dissenters as deviants. If you care about the environment you are a bleeding heart liberal, if you don't support the United States occupation and Halliburton's profiteering in Iraq you are unpatriotic and sometimes even considered a terrorist. These God and Jesus spewing billionaires define right and wrong and what is moral according to their own interests. They will pay pseudo scientists like Steven J. Milloy enormous sums of money to make it appear that there is scientific evidence to support their agenda.",book
1943,"It is true. Figures don't lie but liars can figure. Much, if not all of the problems we face today, and the scares and scams are the result of either the misuses of science data and people or the forced ignoring of scientific truths. Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, is a good start but falls short of all the facts, and most of all, how to turn the tide toward truth. If you are concerned about this subject, read the book but spend the least to acquire it, i.e., buy it as a gift, then read it before giving it away. At least you will get double duty out of money spent. If you are really concerned about this subject, do your research well beyond the books meager coverage, then get involved at the local and state political levels. Keep in mind, if you choose to take such a path that you will come head-on with environmental terrorists such as the lawyers of the Sierra Club, Green Peace, and the likes of others who have perverted the path. The path is a good one, but it is now greatly abused by such groups. Again, the book Junk Science is a `light' start on the subject-an eye opener if you will-that falls short on how to personally make a difference.",book
1944,"If you are a big fan of industry PR campaigns, then this book is for you!However, if you are a critical thinker that is interested in evidence and facts, this book is Junk.Interesting note: The author is affiliated with organizations that are funded by major industries such as 3M, Chevron, Dow Chemical, etc. He is most likely writing what they are paying him to write (e.g. their point of view).",book
1945,"First, I'm a card-carrying skeptic. In fact, I worked for various ""political"" organizations for years. I grew tired of their self-serving, sanctimonious--and largely dubious--charges. Environmental groups were often the worst: ""The world will turn into a cesspool tomorrow unlesss you contribute to us.""Then a friend of mine, an arch-conservative, e-mailed me the web page on which I found this book. It's from the TV network for whose ""news"" the author of this tract contributes. Being a skeptic I still took a close look.That the author is with CATO is a sign, but not a condemnation. (Indeed, I've positively reviewed a book by another CATO associate here in Amazon.com!) I too am somewhat of a libertarian, in a ""liberal"" sort of way. That is, I think governments should not interfere with SOME things, though, agencies like the FDA, even maybe ATF, can be invaluable and NECESSARY resources.But the TV network to which I referred--suffice it to say I won't let that network's ""news"" on the television in my house--combined with CATO, that's a lethal combination.There are scores of useful and reasonably objective books which are skeptical of alarmism out there. This is not one. This is just a propoganda rag for the corporations who think they should be able to do their own thing--while manipulating the public to accept possibly dangerous products and practices. (See ""Trust Us, We're Experts"" suggested by another reviewer, and ""Toxic Sludge is Good for You"" by the same authors.)And don't get wooed by the ""junk science"" in the title. The author is an advocate of another junk science, the one catering to his ideology.",book
1946,"Milloy is more off than on. First of all, he gets his backing from the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian organization that opposes government regulation, especially regulation of industry. Thus it comes as no surprise that his favorite target is 'junk science' which, if left unchecked might, lead to goverment regulation of industry.A lot of what he attacks in fact (in this book, in other books, on his website,) is not 'junk science' at all, but rather those who employ what is called the 'precautionary principle,' in other words the notion that us humans should play it safe when we don't know what it is we are dealing with.It is this doctrine that is the reason that drugs need to be tested in this country before the FDA will allow them to be sold. In other words, government regulation. People like Milloy hate the precautionary principle and it's practitioners becuase they hate regulation.Nevertheless, you might walk away from this book with a little perspective - that science and people are imperfect, and often in error. Perhaps, that science itself is often far from objective. Then again, Milloy is hardly objective himself (although he puports to be.) I would recommend reading something like Toxic Sludge is Good for You! as well for a little more perspective on this important subject, as well as on Milloy himself.",book
1947,"I am a self-proclaimed skeptic. In short, what being a skeptic means to me is that I strive for objectivity in my views through the guiding philosophy of the scientific method. I should hope that Mr. Milloy would admire such convictions. However, in a recent article entitled ""Suburbs Don't Pose Health Risks"" (...)it was unclear to me how he was validating his claims. The only supporting 'evidence' he had was that the recent study by the RAND corporation was able to establish a correlational relationship between suburbia and a myriad of health risks, not a causal one. Taking this criticism and concluding that ""Suburbs Don't Pose Health Risks,"" as Mr. Milloy did, appears to me to be wholly without merit. While he rightly contends that the methodology of the study was fundamentally unable to establish a clear causal relationship, he has absolutely no case for stating that there is no causal relationship between the two without conducting the type of experimental study that he criticizes the RAND study for not having. Either Mr. Milloy has made a serious logical error, or he has some external motivations to discredit the study.I have emailed Mr. MIlloy 4 times over the past week and have received no response to my questions about his claims, which suggests to me that he is not willing to acknowledge criticism. This is possibly the worst trait a scientist can have; and as such I am inclined to cast serious doubt on his scientific credibility. I gave this book a neutral rating because I haven't read it, nor will I read it until Mr. Milloy allows himself to be open to criticism. I eagerly await his response and suggest to other potential buyers that they be cautious in their acceptance of his conclusions (at least until I hear back from him).",book

Nobody cares about the misinformation and the damage to the society.It is an everyday bombardment on every newspaper you read. Health and junk science is there to rise the attention of uneducated people.Unfortunately this status quo is prevailing in the press worldwide.Junk Science Judo by Steven J. Milloy is a must and a real jewell amidst so much fat information and misleading junk science publicized nowadays.I give it a 5 star rate.Jorge Brown Segui",book
1949,"Whether you are a newbie in science, or do research, Milloy's work is exceptionally relevant, and at the same time intensely interesting.Sadly, there seem to be very few people doing exactly what is needed in this growing area of scientific vandalism, and I applaud Milloy's courage in writing this work and others on the same or similar topic. He shows great creativity in the style and format used to write this work. It is exceptionally interesting to read, and captivates. My copy was on my office desk for exactly three days, and then without a routing list made it way through some of the science staff.I wish I had kept the statistics on this, and could plot the exact point that this work seeded an intense discussion. Perhaps a critical mass of people had been reached, and the fallout was exceptional. I suppose it will simply take more time as more and more people read, and understand the difficulties Milloy cites. It would be a shame to re-live the problems of yesteryear, and with Milloy showing the problems before they become epidemic, a double shame.Awareness if so very difficult to acquire, but Milloy does help open eyes. I would heartily recommend this book.",book

1951,"Junk Science Judo Exposes the non-critical nature of journalists and politicians towards ""science."" Once clothed in the garb of ""science"" any and all claims are relayed with breathless hysteria and stated with the sort of dogmatic certainty that would make the pope nervous. Of course, with each and every one of these claims, immediate action is necessary and litigation and new laws are rushed through with dramatic, life saving urgency. The reality is that one or even two scientific studies isn't enough to base legislation on. That's where the ever so handy precautionary principle comes in. If it MIGHT be harmful, it needs to be outlawed. Like DDT. Who cares about millions of Africans dying of malaria? DDT might (though there is little or no actual proof) be harmful to waterfowl!",book

Aided by television and print media interested more in attracting audiences than in reporting fact, Milloy exposes the less-than-pure motives behind the so-called science, offering a layman's explanation of the tools, techniques, and statistical analysis to determine fact from fraud, and to draw logical conclusions independent of the hype. While some of the chapters discussing the actual statistical technique may run a bit dry, for the most part this is a quick and entertaining read. In addition to taking on controversial topics like DDT, PCBs, and dioxin, Milloy debunks popular environmental mega myths including Agent Orange, Love Canal, Cancer Clusters, Three Mile Island, and others. While you may have always believed the ""science"" behind much today's highly publicized health risks suspect, ""Junk Science Judo"" will arm you with the facts behind the politics, and some common sense to counter the hysteria.",book

Much casting is demonstrated by series of high speed photography frames showing what is (or should be) going on with the rod, line and arm at any given point during the cast.It also describes how to make advanced casts such as ""Roll"", ""Hook"" and ""Steeple"" casts.Also consider the author's other book - ""Troubleshooting the Cast"".",book

1960,"I started fly fishing for trout in the watershed for NYC, which was pleasant and uncrowded at one time, though it is neither now. In any case, the streams were small and brushy and being an obsessive, I tried about a dozen rods before settling on what I liked to cast -- a short fiberglass rod from Scott. Then one day I decided to buy a fast action saltwater rod to fish for stripers in the Long Island sound. I quickly learned that I didn't really know how to cast that kind of rod that kind of distance, let alone into the wind. About a year later, I took an introductory class on fly fishing with my father whom I had talked into learning the sport. Ed Jaworowski was the teacher. I can say first hand that he can cast a fly line an incredible distance -- and he can teach how. His book had just come out at the time, though I didn't acquire a copy until recently. After all these years, I can say that this is an excellent book on casting the fly rod in a way that maximizes the efficiency of the rod; I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in saltwater fly fishing in particular.",book

1964,"From my review in the January 1, 2006 New York Post:WHAT should a woman do when attacked by a criminal? Should she behave passively? Use pepper spray? A gun?Most people hope they'll get lucky and never be attacked. For those who want to think ahead, there is Paxton Quigley's new book, ""Stayin' Alive.""It turns out that pepper spray may not do you a lot of good when it is raining or snowing. A woman is just as likely to disable herself as the attacker when it's windy or when using the spray indoors.Knives and baseball bats are particularly problematic, because women have to get very close to their attackers to use them, and male criminals - that is, most criminals - tend to be much stronger physically than their female victims. When it comes to physical contact, women generally lose those fights.The advantage of a gun is that it is ideal for keeping the criminal far away from the victim. And the victim isn't responsible for restraining the criminal, as police officers are when arresting suspects. A woman simply wants to keep the criminal away from her.There have been a lot of good books lately exploding the myth that guns endanger people's safety. (And at least one very notable movie, Larry Elder's ""Michael & Me,"" devastatingly tackles many of the false claims in Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine."") Quigley's book covers a lot of ground, such as the myths about personal defense, when it is appropriate to use lethal force, whether there are any risks to firing a gun while pregnant (apparently not), how often children are killed by accidental gun shots (very rarely) and how one goes about choosing the best gun for a particular individual's needs. The book answers these questions from a woman's perspective.What works defensively for men doesn't always work for women. As Quigley points out, women who used a gun to resist an attack were 2.5 times more likely to escape uninjured than those who behaved passively. Guns aren't as beneficial for men. They are only 1.4 times more likely to escape uninjured than those who behaved passively.The book includes real-life examples of defensive gun use and offers academic research on the millions of times each year that people use guns defensively. These good-news stories help Quigley illustrate how women actually react in life-threatening situations. And she also does well explaining what women should know before choosing a gun.The book could have gone further debunking common misperceptions about guns. Take the claim that ""you're more likely to shoot yourself or a family member than kill an attacker."" This study assumed that whenever anyone in a gun-owning home was killed by a gun, it was that gun that caused the harm. But academics have found that at least 86 percent of the time, that assumption was wrong - and most of other cases were suicides.While recent polls show that more households own guns after 9/11, there is still a lot of fear and uncertainty about guns, which may keep people from doing what is best for their family's safety. Quigley's book cuts through a lot of that unjustified fear.John R. Lott Jr. is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of ""The Bias Against Guns.""",book
1965,"Paxton Quigley is at it again in her 2004 book, ""Stayin' Alive."" Many people, for many various reasons, strongly object to women possessing guns. All who prey upon women object to armed females because their prey isn't supposed to even think about fighting back. Others have a death fetish.A far deadlier device is the automobile. People who object to women driving and riding automobiles are shunned in our society. The real reason is that driving is a sign of maturity, responsibility, and independence in our culture. Yet the automobile is a bigger killer than guns, and guns are intended to be dangerous-it makes guns useful as a deterrent and useful for shutting off an attack. My personal opinion is that if someone isn't responsible enough to own a gun, they shouldn't be licensed to drive automobiles either. The automobile is harder to use safely-guns are really simple mechanical devices.In ""Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World,"" Paxton Quigley provides success stories of women saving their own lives and the lives of their children with handguns. She discusses the issues of child safety-and ""CAP laws"" (Child Access Prevention). Quigley taught me a few things in her book: warnings about how your VIN compromises your automobile's anti-theft devices and security measures for your checks and your stolen wallet are useful information for anybody. In addition to providing evidence against the modern media-driven urban myths about firearms, Quigley covers tactics, formal schools, buying guns, choosing ammunition and equipment, and recommending non-gun alternative weapons. There is even a chapter on ""Sport Shooting and Hunting,"" which most women probably won't find interesting-despite feminist rhetoric about access to the ""boys' tree house,"" guns and hunting are still regarded as a ""guy thing."" This may be the only exposure to hunting for many women-I recommend everyone get a hunting license even if they don't hunt because the hunter safety course by your state's wildlife management department will introduce you to gun safety, you'll learn about your state's wild animals, and you'll have a better idea of what is going on in ""public lands."" Plus, your license fee will care for public lands and the creatures living on them. You need not hunt simply because you got a license! I find it funny that so many know nothing about a subject, yet have their own ""expert opinion"" on it. Guns are not for everyone. Being informed about guns, even if you cannot or will not own any, is important for any adult who can vote. ""Stayin' Alive"" isn't the last word in gun knowledge, but you could do worse.I am fairly knowledgeable about firearms-23 years in the military, two decades of security officer experience (with anti-terrorist work), and a library of gun books. I don't know everything about guns, so I keep adding to my library. ""Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World"" is a worthwhile addition to my library. Paxton Quigley taught me new things in her book. This book is more about WHY having a gun may be good than how to use a gun-and gives the reader a tool to find qualified instructors. It is finally sinking in that adults need to provide their own bottom-line security because nobody else will.",book
1966,"It is ironic that the people who need to have a gun the most are the ones who are afraid to own one: women. Paxton Quigley has been working to change all that. This little book gives a quickie course on what women need to know and why they need to know it. The book contains a number of true stories of women using guns to protect themselves. And as every such book needs to do, it exposes all the lies the media tell about guns.Give a copy of this to every woman friend you have. After reading this, you'll be wondering why you and everyone else in this society has been so convinced for so long that it is a bad thing to have a gun around. This book explodes many of the lies and myths that have been packed around the image of the gun and the notion of gun-ownership, as well as the image of gun owners (read ""gun nuts""). The biggest myth, of course, is ""911"". People infer almost magical powers to dialing 911. Read this book and find out why only doing that is suicidal.The Second Amendment is needed now more than ever, because now not only the Second but the First and Fourth Amendments are slipping away; and this is happening at the most critical time in our history. If you don't know why, readWhile America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within. Things are going to get worse, much worse. People living near the border already have guns: they need them every day. But illegals and jihadists are being bussed throughout the country. They blend in with the peaceful and moderate and are ""invisible"" until they strike. Then, everyone says, ""why didn't we see them?""

That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.",book
1968,"There has been no finer, more consistent author in the realm of balanced, incisive information on the topics of women, firearms and contemporary society. Paxton's ""Armed and Female"" is the definitive work, and ""Stayin' Alive"" represents the next logical step. I strongly recommend these to my students; even more important, I recommend these works to anyone who truly wants to understand the ""why"" and ""why not"" of conscientious self-protection in the 21st Century. Knowledge truly is the light of the mind. -D. Crafton, DMD/Arizona Ranger/AZ DPS Firearms Safety Instructor-CCW.",book
1969,"I first heard Paxton Quigley's name mentioned by Tom Brokaw on NBC Nightly News, then I saw her on 60 Minutes and on Oprah. Media don't impress me but this lady does. I really liked her first two books and bought them to give to female friends and relatives. This one, Stayin' Alive, is her best yet.100 years ago it may have been the men's job to keep their 'womenfolk' safe but certainly no longer today. Today a woman has to prepare herself to encounter violent predators - mentally, physically and with hardware - because she will. It's not 'paranoia' if they are really after you - and they are. If you read only one book on the subject it should be this one.",book
1970,"Expertly written by Paxton Quigly, ""Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World"" presents a detailed exploration into the issues of female self-protection. On page after page the reader will discover practical advice on handling diverse threatening situations, critically important commentary to which they may refer when finding themselves in such positions. The problems of rape, molestation, and undesired groping are effectively dealt with through the mean of furthering of education of the reader with what Paxton Quigly has to offer her readers. ""Stayin' Alive; Armed And Female In An Unsafe World"" is a very strongly recommended reading and instructive, practical guide for women seeking their own form of defense from sexual predators and physical abusers.",book
1971,"Stayin Alive is a book which responsibly examines the important issues facing gun owners in today's world. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on children and guns, a major issue for parents who own weapons. I appreciate Ms. Quigley's discussion of when to talk with children about guns, as well as her advice on safe gun storage. This book should be a must read for all families with guns in the house.",book
1972,"I'm not a fan of the NRA. Shooting my mouth off is more my style. However, Paxton Quigley's take on firearms and women is so sensible, it makes me feel ridiculous for not taking this practical step toward self-protection. I'm not afraid of shooting an assailant...I'm pretty sure I could aerate any thug who broke into my home or who threatened me or my loved ones and do a big high five afterwards. My concern is that, in confrontational situations, I start to shake, and I'm afraid I'd never be able to hit the target. Ms. Quigley provides us with a very readable book that answers a lot of questions and clears up a lot of misinformation. She gives us a basic education on types of guns, how to choose the right one, selecting ammunition (there are types of ammo that will blast such a wide area, you barely have to aim at your target...perfect for trembling types like me. Paxton is not a one-note diva. She also gives sensible and practical tips on non-gun types of self defense, and does a great job explaining what works and what's just going to get you in more trouble. Forget the can of pepper spray, for example. It works only when the weather is right and the wind is blowing away from you. I've read defense books that are still telling us to ""jam that spike heel into the attacker's foot."" Fine, except what if I'm wearing running shoes...or that pair of Laboutins that are individually worth more than anything else I own? Stepping on an attacker's foot is annoying, not crippling. Now you have a cranky rapist on your hands. Paxton's suggestions are designed to delay the attacker long enough so a woman can make her getaway. Much more sensible than trying to disable someone with a toe stomp. Whether one chooses to heavy up or not, reading this book provides food for thought, do-able safety tips and reasonable ways to defend yourslf. The best self-protection is prevention. Locking doors and windows, being aware of your surroundings, noticing what--and who--is around you, avoiding obvious danger areas. For women who can reasonably say that are at some risk, I'd say ""buy a gun and Paxton's book."" For others in less precarious positions, I'd say ""Buy Paxton's book and then decide.""",book
1973,Stayin' Alive is a real eye-opener. I think all women and men should read this book. It will change their minds about having a gun. The stories are really intriguing.,book
1974,"As a trainer and proponent for women in the the shooting sports and women learning how to protect themselves, this book and a few others closely related to this book are among the required reading that they should find. ANY instructor that wishes to train women effectively must read this book and the others like it to understand what it really means to be a female and want to carry a gun. Too many instructors think they can teach women the same way as men and they are wrong. Do your research, adjust your educational approach, and learn how to train women.As a woman looking to learn about this whole, wild, world of defensive shooting, you should educate yourself by doing YOUR research as well. You'll be able to weed out the bad from the good. This will make your learning experience much batter and more efficient.Good luck! Happy reading and happy shooting!Dave JenkinsRochester Personal Defense[...]",book

1977,"When women ask me about safety and firearms, this is the first book I recommend to help them on their terms.",book
1978,"All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction.",book
1979,"Paxton Quigley's book is a compliation of parts of other books on firearms self protection. It's a bit overdone, and probably would scare the average woman thinking about protecting herself. Women seem to have special problems protecting themselves. They usually do not want to hurt anyone, and they will do all most anything for a baby or a family member before they will do anything to protect themselves. However, women that are able to continue to practice with a hand gun, usually become quite proficent. They know that they don't know, and they listen to instructions. Most men think they know it all already.",book
1980,"While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive.",book
1981,"Michael J. Russ' Powerful Golf: Lower Your Golf Score By Changing The Way You Think is a 77-minute CD audiobook that teaches the listeners how to improve their golf scores by taking control of their attitudes and emotions. From learning to rise above anger and frustration; to the use of heightened awareness; the implementation of practical self-talk; and the transcendental virtue of forgiveness, Powerful Golf presents itself as an exceptional motivational guide and especially appropriate for a sport in which confidence makes or breaks the player. If you play a dedicated game of golf, then Powerful Golf is the audiobook for you!",book
1982,"I only picked up golf last October and though I have taken many lessons I seemed to be stuck in a rut. I love to listen to books on tape when I am driving, it makes the time go faster. So when I saw this book about golf on, it seemed perfect. Not only was it easy to listen to, but it was also very clear and concise. The author is very focused on getting your mental game in order as a way to lower your golf score. I didn't realize what a big part the mental game played until I listened to this. My score has begun to drop off its plateau and I am now hovering in the 103 range. With these concepts in place each time I play I feel that I will be playing bogey golf within the month. Kudos to the author for touching on a subject which is rarely taught and seldom thought about.",book
1983,"I purchased this audio book for my husband whose game is well beyond the skill level addressed in this book. He told me this book would probably be good for players hoping to break 90, who need help with developing the proper golf swing.",book
1984,"My 19 year old son took up golf about 3 years ago, and seemed to enjoy it - but for the fact that if he missed a shot he would throw his clubs, pitch a tantrum, and mess up the remainder of his game. It took about 3 weeks, but this audio book helped us work on him focusing on what was important, and letting go of the bad stuff. After all, we ALL have bad games. Now, he's much better at taking his time, and when his ball is in the bushes, he deals with it, and let's it go.",book
1985,"Although John Gray is known mainly for his poetry, this volume collects many of his prose works. His short novel Park is included in full, as are reviews and short stories collected from various sources. Many are reprinted here for the first time since their initial publication. This is an invaluable companion volume to Ian Fletcher's collection of Gray's poetry, and an excellent insight into a much neglected writer from Britain's late Victorian era.",book
1986,"This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me.",book
1987,"After having been told about this book by a good friend who also could not believe it she was finally able to get the copy borrowed again from her co-worker. The first 50 pages or so were mildly interesting only if the topic interested you (it didn't interest me) and if you lean towards people having sometimes idiotic arguments appeals to you. Then after around six weeks of this nonsense is when the ""author"" gets involved in the tpic discussion. The ""author"" seems to have an agenda right from the start and yes that agenda seeems to be agitation, irritation, sowing discord and creating a climate to intentionally encourage retaliation. I even wondered if the objective right from the start was to create a scene where the ""author"" would then be able to do noting more than copy all of the postings and caal it a book. In his conclusion he speas of a sequel which makes one think even more that this was a ""set up"" from the start. And the concluding posting is such a childish example of ""getting in the last word"" and in such a demeaning way that the author should be ashamed. Glad this was a borrowed book!",book
1988,"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book"".",book
1989,"I first read &quot;Create a Life....&quot; about a year ago at a time when I had been phased out of a job I thought I loved, my mother died and a friend was suffering from depression. I was angry, stressed and burnt out. As a sort of one year anniversary gift to myself I have just re-read the book. It is concise. The writing is clear and crisp, and the ideas are beautifully supported with everyday examples. Among the most meaningful tidbits for me are the three words, &quot;You are enough.&quot; For most of my life the more I accomplished the harder I pushed. I was rewarded with bonuses and kudos and still felt the need to compete. Finally, I gave myself permission to get off the merry go round and pursue other interests. And as Zoglio advises, I let go of anger and resentment and began to take care of myself. I now choose what I do. I have time for volunteering and time for me. This is a book of simple truths... if you want love and abundance in your life, give it away. If you believe in something, believe in it all the way. Choose how you use each day of your life. The pages are filled with passion. My best advise after the reading the book a second time is buy one for a friend.",book
1990,"Jack Canfield (Chicken Soup for the Soul) was right on the mark when he called Tickle Your Soul a ""gem"". Having recently read the book, when I think of gem and Tickle in the same context, the ""Hope"" Diamond comes to mind. Boomers.....there IS Hope. Talk about a wake up call! Until I read Tickle, I never really thought in terms of a second phase of life the way the author presents it (the best one!). I enjoyed Dr. Zoglio's approach to ""reinventing your life"" as she takes you through a touching, thought provoking, empowering process where you will, among other things, let go of old baggage, move out of your comfort zone, dream, find your purpose, and take action. I found the exercises to be fun and easy, and they left me feeling enlightened, energized and focused.Tickle is loaded with practical wisdom, so I suggest a highlighter. True, you will have your own Life's Purpose Plan to follow, but it is nice to be able to quickly reference those gems that lit you up in the first place. I do it to re-energize and stay on track. Just a few of my favorites: ""You deserve a life that is exquisitely tailored to the uniqueness of you."" ""No one else knows what pictures fill your mind or what passions fuel your heart."" ""Passion in life stems from a forward focus. If we are not growing, learning and evolving, we will begin to wither inside."" ""Suddenly, we have an urge to do what we've always wanted to do...before it's too late.""Dr. Zoglio has done a masterful job of taking a formidable task, and presenting it in a very manageable, doable and enjoyable process. When I finished Tickle I thought....""it can't be this easy!"". Well, I had an opportunity very recently to share a few of her exercise questions with a relative that was really struggling with some life's purpose/passion issues. The results: Truly incredible...almost miraculous! I highly recommend this book. Don't waste a precious moment. Tickle your soul, live your life with purpose, and follow your dreams!",book
1991,I received &quot;Create A Life That Tickles Your Soul&quot; as a gift from friends as a means of inspiring me during the most overwhelming time in my life. I had turned forty a few months earlier and my husband of nearly eleven years had just died. I was facing a myriad of challenges and this book was like a beacon in the darkness. It affirmed much that I already knew and helped me open doors in my life just as many were closing behind me. I found Suzanne's writing style to be flowing and the message both educational and enlivening. It was as if I was sitting comortably in my living room and engaging in conversation with a friend. The book mark embellished with a feather is taped to my computer monitor as a reminder that I can do anything I set my mind and heart upon. Thank you Suzanne for the blessing that is your book! I've recommended it to others whose souls need tickling too.,book
1992,"A dear friend of mine gave me this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dr. Zoglio does an excellent job of describing the keys to happiness. Long ago, I independently arrived at many of the same conclusions about happiness, but I have never been able to articulate them as clearly and simply as Dr. Zoglio does in her book. While reading it, I found myself underlining text and writing notes on almost every page. I have subsequently bought my friend her own copy and also bought copies for my two grown-up children with the hope that the book will &quot;tickle&quot; them, too.",book
1993,"This is the kind of book you want to keep nearby, by that I mean it does not belong in the book case but perhaps on the breakfast table or next to that favourite chair in the den. When I bought the first copy(for myself)I opened it to the chapter titled &quot;Make a difference every day&quot;. This is the chapter I read first. Since then, I have refered to most of the content of this book, many times. Dr.Zoglio writes in a way that makes &quot;The Tickle book&quot; easy reading and one does not have to be a therapist or a group facilitator to understand and get the message! &quot;Tickle&quot; is inspirational,uplifting and it gives a great dose of positiveness...all of which we need in large quantities, especially these days!",book
1994,"I really enjoyed this one! Zoglio's book provides an interesting perspective to change your mid life &quot;crisis&quot; to a mid life &quot;awakening&quot;. Her book reinforces the idea that life continues to provide exciting opportunities, if we just take the time to look. The book is full of practical information, easily digested, with a simple 7 step guide to get what you really want out of your life.",book
1995,"I happened on this &quot;every woman should have a copy&quot; book and have been guarding it jealously since then. I savor it bit by bit and share it only with those I deem worthy, or those who have demonstrated some interest in re-creating their mundane existence.I have just started leading Caribbean women (by way of Self-Development &amp; Empowerment workshops) to the re-invention of their personal &amp; professional lives. To say this book has inspired me is putting it mildly. It has indeed been a catharsis for my own self - development. Brava!!",book
1996,"&quot;Tickle&quot; is as beautiful inside as it is outside. After reading it, you'll understand why this is a treasure you will be delighted to recommend to anyone or to give as a gift. This easy-to-read guide will inspire you to take charge of choices in your life and encourage you to live the life you've always dreamed of. A great, upbeat volume that will compel you to re-read it again and again. In our area, Dr. Zoglio is practicing what she preaches - an overwhelmingly generous portion of the sale of &quot;Tickle&quot; books sold by Habitat for Humanity in Bucks County go to support that organization. Don't miss this outstanding work by an equally outstanding author!",book
